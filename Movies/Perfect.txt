=== development and production ===
the film is based on mickey rapkin's non-fiction book pitch perfect: the quest for collegiate a cappella glory. rapkin, senior editor at gq magazine, spent a season covering competitive collegiate a cappella. he followed the tufts university beelzebubs, the university of oregon divisi (the loose inspiration for the bellas), and the university of virginia hullabahoos, who have a cameo in the film. rapkin's book mainly covers the singing, groupies, partying and rivalries. two members of the a cappella community, deke sharon, who founded the international championship of college a cappella, and ed boyer, both in rapkin's book, were brought on board to arrange songs, produce vocals and act as on-site music directors, where they ran a month-long "a cappella boot camp". the film was shot throughout campus and inside buildings at louisiana state university in baton rouge, louisiana. elizabeth banks is a co-producer and a co-star in the film.


=== casting ===
the casting department included justin coulter, rich delia, allison estrin, and michael roth. one of the producers, paul brooks, stated "first and foremost, we were looking for actors who had comedic instincts and thought we'd get lucky with terrific actors who happened to be funny and can actually dance and maybe sing. it turns out we did get lucky with our cast!" according to producer elizabeth banks, "the character beca required someone who was grounded, who has a strong point of view on the world, who is funny and empathetic and someone who we can all relate to and root for." of kendrick she said, "anna is all those things, and there was no other choice." fellow producer brooks said "i saw anna in up in the air and thought it was the most exquisite, elegant, balanced, sublime performance. anna was our first choice for the role of beca."when casting the character of jesse, max handelman said "we were looking for a young john cusack-type guy. we needed to find someone who was kind of awkward but not a geek, but not so cool that you're not rooting for him." skylar astin was chosen for the role. of astin's audition, banks said the chemistry between skylar and anna when they read together prior to shooting was "clear and they were able to riff off each other."rebel wilson was recognized for her performance in the comedy film bridesmaids upon auditioning for the role of fat amy, which she won instantly. moore recalled wilson singing lady gaga's "the edge of glory" while beating "on her chest with her fists." he said, "i didn't even hear the end of the song because i was laughing so hard. there's this beautiful openness to the way rebel approaches everything, and that's what works great for the character. she's fearless." adam devine was personally chosen by banks and handelman for the role of bumper after they saw him on the television series workaholics. banks said that she and her husband are "big workaholics fans," and after watching one night during the film's casting, they saw devine and "immediately thought" he would be a good choice for bumper. he initially declined because he was not a singer. devine eventually surprised banks and handelman with his vocal skills. anna camp was chosen for the role of aubrey. producer max handelman said, "elizabeth and i were huge fans of anna's from true blood. aubrey is set up as the antagonist for beca, and beca's already a bit hard-edged, so it was so important to find an actress who could play aubrey as someone who could marshal the crazy but also was sympathetic."  kelley jakle was brought in as a "ringer" due to her past experience as a two-time icca champion with the socal vocals and had also appeared on two seasons of the sing-off.
