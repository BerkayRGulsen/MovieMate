danny's older brother francisco, nicknamed "ghost", is released from a long prison stint. his relationship with his father is also strained, due to miguel's past drinking problem, the way he treated their mother and the fact that he didn't go visit him while he was in prison. danny enters into a relationship with a young photographer, lorelei, that exposes him to a different avenue to share his graffiti skills.   ghost and danny decide to enter their own car in the big elysian park lowrider competition, against their father's legendary "green poison."
