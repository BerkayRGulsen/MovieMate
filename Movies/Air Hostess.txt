== reception ==
considered along with other aviation films of the era, air hostess is a modest, b-film but has some redeeming qualities that have stood the film well over the years. a contemporary review in the new york times noted: "... is pleasantly acted by james murray, arthur pierson and evalyn knapp. thelma todd interprets the seductive blonde so heavily as to flavor the whole picture with a tinge of burlesque. some of the air sequences have their moments of excitement, but air hostess needs more than airplanes to conceal the antiquity of its plot." in reviewing air hostess in a historical sense, the extensive use of the aircraft of the period now provides a near-documentary look at north american civil aviation in 1933.
