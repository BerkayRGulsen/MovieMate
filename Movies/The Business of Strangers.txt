nick joins them, explaining that his flight was also canceled. paula rushes off to the bathroom and is followed by julie, who wants to know what was wrong. later, paula informs her that nick raped a friend of hers in boston. julie is shocked but eventually convinced, and suggests they get revenge. paula tells her to just forget about it.
