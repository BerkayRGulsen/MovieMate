== plot ==
when mysterious, unpiloted, midget aircraft start landing in southern england during the second world war, secret agent wing commander blenkinsop, vc and bar, is chosen for a top-secret mission to occupied france to investigate. meanwhile, as a diversionary tactic to deceive the germans, his exact look-alike, aircraftsman [sic] atwood (both parts are played by rix), is reluctantly recruited to go to north africa. however, through a farcical mixup, blenkinsop finds himself in africa and atwood ends up in france. 
by far more luck than judgement, atwood returns to england in one of the buzz bombs, and, with everyone (including blenkinsop's girlfriend) believing he is blenkinsop, he continues the impersonation and becomes a national hero, while the real blenkinsop desperately tries to regain his identity and his life.

== critical reception ==
sky movies wrote, "a typically rickety british farce of the late fifties, a time when the carry on's were gaining their first foothold. this is a sort of carry on flying: brian rix has a field day in a dual role and there's even william hartnell, giving his comic all as yet another barking nco. broad, unpolished, lowbrow fun."
