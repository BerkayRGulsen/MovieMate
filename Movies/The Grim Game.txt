== production ==
the grim game was produced by the famous players-lasky company, shot at demille field number 2. the aerial sequences were to feature a new stunt, where houdini would hang by a rope from an aircraft and drop into the cockpit of an aircraft flying below. in the media, houdini claimed that he was "scorning the use of a stunt man". in actuality, the film company advertised for a stunt double to take houdini's place. robert e. kennedy, a former army air force flight instructor, applied and received a contract for the dangerous stunt.


=== mid-air collision ===
the mid-air collision in the grim game was not scripted. it was a real accident caught on film over the skies of santa monica, california. david e. thompson was flying with stuntman robert e. kennedy, doubling houdini, hanging from the landing gear. as the two curtiss jn-4 "jennys" lined up, a sudden gust of wind pushed thompson's aircraft into the lower aircraft flown by christopher pickup, with his landing gear jamming into the top wing of the lower aircraft. as the two aircraft spun down, thompson's aircraft flipped upside down while al wilson, flying the camera aircraft, followed the tangle of aircraft down.both aircraft managed to free themselves at about 200 ft. and were able to land although thompson's aircraft was still upside down. no one was killed, and the story was rewritten to incorporate the accident. publicity was geared heavily toward promoting this dramatic "caught on film" moment, claiming it was houdini himself dangling from the aircraft.


== reception ==
the contemporary film review of the grim game  in the new york times, noted, "the familiar feats, with which he (houdini) has entertained audiences for so many years, were more baffling than ever, and airplanes, high-powered motor cars, and heights of treetops were brought into service to give the audience the best possible thrill in stock. for the first time, too, houdini combines love with his daredevil accomplishments, and throughout the picture his attractive young sweetheart is carried from the secret recesses of a wild hunting lodge, guarded by desperate-looking characters, to perilous heights in the clouds just out of reach of her courageous hero."ever the showman, houdini himself appeared at the broadway theatre, new york, for the first screening, proclaiming that he would offer $1,000 to anyone "who could prove that the collision was not an authentic one." he further detailed that the mid-air collision took place at 4,000 ft, a height that allowed both aircraft to recover and land safely.aviation film historian james farmer in celluloid wings: the impact of movies on aviation (1984) considered the grim game an example of a film that allowed houdini to "showcase his celebrated stage skills."


== preservation ==
