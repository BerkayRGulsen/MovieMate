anne osborne (ellen barkin), a state district attorney, is sent to investigate alleged police corruption. after seeing firsthand some unorthodox practices by remy, anne accuses him of being on the take. he argues that she does not have an understanding of how the system works in new orleans for police.
despite osborne's suspicious and apprehensive feelings towards him, they form a relationship. mcswain is caught accepting payoffs in an internal affairs sting, and osborne has the burden of prosecuting him. with the assistance of fellow officers within the police force, the evidence is destroyed and suppressed. mcswain is cleared of the charges, at which point anne, now clued in, is faced with the conflict of her personal feelings for remy and her duty to uphold the law.
it is later revealed that jack kellom (ned beatty), remy's boss, and the two detectives de soto (john goodman) and dodge (ebbe roe smith) are behind the murder, and a stash of heroin is hidden at a boat yard. kellom goes to the boat and is confronted by de soto and dodge. kellom suggests getting rid of the drugs, but de soto shoots kellom. remy and anne arrive and are confronted by de soto and dodge, and a shootout starts, resulting in de soto being shot by a fatally wounded kellom, and dodge being shot with a flare gun by remy, which starts a fire, and remy and anne make a run for it in the nick of time just before the boat explodes.

the city of new orleans and its atmospherics function as a protagonist in the film. this is evident from the beginning of the film: the opening is an aerial shot of the new orleans bayou and the cajun band beausoleil plays "zydeco gris gris" on the soundtrack (title sequence).

=== critical response ===
roger ebert, film critic of the chicago sun-times, lauded the film, and wrote, "the big easy is one of the richest american films of the year. it also happens to be a great thriller. i say 'happens,' because i believe the plot of this movie is only an excuse for its real strength: the creation of a group of characters so interesting, so complicated and so original they make a lot of other movie people look like paint-by-number characters."sheila benson, writing for the los angeles times, wrote, "screenwriter daniel petrie jr. sets up the conflict, and director jim mcbride fleshes it out with devastating, sexy assurance..."film critic vincent canby was a bit tougher on the film, and wrote, "remy and anne are made for each other, or would have been if the big easy were the sophisticated comedy it could have been...[the film] was directed by jim mcbride who one day is going to come up with a commercial movie that works all the way through, and not just in patches."the review aggregator rotten tomatoes reported that 89% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 35 reviews with the consensus: "loaded with atmosphere and drenched in the sizzling chemistry between dennis quaid and ellen barkin, the big easy remains one of the strongest -- and steamiest -- thrillers of the 1980s." the film is praised for the accuracy of quaid's cajun accent, which he meticulously researched in preparation for the role. however, residents of the new orleans area were not so pleased, referring to it as "cringe-inducing."
