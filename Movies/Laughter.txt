laughter in the dark (french: la chambre obscure) is a 1969 french-british drama film directed by tony richardson and starring nicol williamson and anna karina. it is based on the novel of the same name by vladimir nabokov. nicol williamson was brought in as a very late replacement for richard burton, who had already shot several scenes. the director, tony richardson, found burton's lack of punctuality intolerable.for the film, the story's setting was changed from 1930s berlin to the swinging london of the 1960s. the film drew respectable reviews, but for reasons that are unclear, it was subsequently removed from distribution. the film has only twice been shown on british television, (in 1974 and 1981 on bbc2), and has not been released on any home video format. laszlo papas was slated to direct a 1986 remake of the film which would have starred mick jagger as axel rex and rebecca de mornay as the young seductress; de mornay was replaced by maryam d'abo after disagreements with the director, but ultimately the project went nowhere and the film was never made.
