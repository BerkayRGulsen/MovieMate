=== life lessons ===
lionel dobie is an acclaimed abstract artist who finds himself unable to paint during the days before a scheduled gallery exhibition of his new work. paulette is lionel's assistant and former lover. lionel is still infatuated with her, but paulette wants only his tutelage, which makes things difficult since they live in the same studio-loft. paulette dates other people, including a performance artist and a painter.
these deliberate provocations on paulette's part make lionel insanely jealousand fuel his creativity. lionel and paulette, it becomes clear, have been using each other: lionel using her sexually, paulette using him as a means of entry into the higher spheres of the new york social and art scene. paulette wants to give up and go home to her parents but lionel persuades her to stay because new york is where a painter needs to be.
lionel pours his anxiety and repressed passion into his work. paintings around the studio show visual metaphors from relations past: stormy skies, burning bridges, and tormented clowns. lionel realizes that he needs the emotional turmoil of his destructive relationships in order to fuel his art. at the art exhibit, lionel meets another attractive young woman, a struggling painter. he persuades her to become his assistant and potentially his lover, beginning the cycle anew.

=== critical response ===
new york stories holds a 75% "fresh" rating on rotten tomatoes from 24 reviews.allen and scorsese's segments of the film have generally been praised. however, hal hinson, writing in the washington post felt that coppola's segment was "by far the director's worst work yet." roger ebert of chicago sun-times gave the film two and a half stars, saying "new york stories consists of three films, one good, one bad, one disappointing."  he further explained, "of the three films, the only really successful one is life lessons, the scorsese story of a middle-age painter and his young, discontented girlfriend. the coppola, an updated version of the story of eloise, the little girl who lived in the plaza hotel, is surprisingly thin and unfocused. and the allen, about a 50-year-old man still dominated by his mother, starts well but then takes a wrong turn about halfway through."
