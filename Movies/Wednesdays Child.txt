==== season 2 ====
a 97% approval rating for the second season was reported by rotten tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.54/10 based on 33 reviews, and a critical consensus reading, "in its second season, the sinner establishes itself as an engrossing why-dunnit thriller series with staying power." metacritic assigned a score of 75 out of 100 based on 16 critics for the second season, indicating "generally favorable reviews".once again praising the writing and performances, several critics noted that the follow-up season surpassed expectations, as star jessica biel's character did not return from the first season.
alex mclevy of the a.v. club wrote a rave review of the first few episodes, in particular the performance of carrie coon as the mysterious vera walker. mclevy wrote that the second season could be even better than the first, noting, 

"two things keep it from feeling like a rehash of season one: the excellent choices in new narrative twists made by writer-creator derek simonds, and the caliber of talent involved in bringing it to life. chief among the latter group is carrie coon, who ... brings a wonderful fusion of frazzled humanism and sinister duplicity to the part, another magnetic performance by the actor that elevates the material and lends gravitas to some of the more daffily implausible turns."
ben travers of indiewire wrote, 

"derek simonds assembled a helluva team for an intriguing follow-up season. the first three episodes of season 2 match the tone and intensity of the writer's gripping debut, while new cast members tracy letts, natalie paul, and carrie coon more than make up for any holes left by the original cast. ... season 2 has enough going on it could spin off the rails, but the mere fact it has so much working for it thus far is a big win for everyone involved. the sinner is no one-hit wonder."


==== season 3 ====
on rotten tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 85% with an average rating of 7.28/10 based on 13 reviews. metacritic has assigned a score of 81 out of 100 based on five critics for the third season, indicating "universal acclaim".
