== plot ==
greta evans, an american foreigner from montana travels to the united kingdom after being hired as a nanny by the elderly heelshires. upon her arrival, the couple introduce greta to her charge: a lifesize porcelain doll named brahms that they treat like their son. the heelshires coach greta on taking care of brahms and their house while they are on holiday; leaving her a list of strict rules to follow, including reading to brahms in a loud, clear voice and playing loud music for him.
initially, greta ignores the rules. she regularly calls her sister, who tells her that her abusive ex-boyfriend cole has been trying to find out where she is. malcolm, the local deliveryman, stops by often, and greta learns that the real brahms was killed in a fire 20 years ago on his eighth birthday. malcolm asks greta out, and she accepts. while preparing for the date, her dress and jewelry vanish while she is in the shower; she is lured to the attic by strange noises and locked inside, and is mysteriously let out the next morning. she explains to malcolm what happened, and they discuss the real brahms, whom malcolm says mr. heelshire described as "odd".
strange events occur: a child's sobs are heard in the hallways, phone calls are cut off, and the doll seems to move on its own. after receiving a phone call in which a child's voice urges her to follow the rules, greta locks herself in her room. she then finds a peanut butter and jelly sandwich outside her door, her favorite, and the child's voice promises he will be good. believing that brahms' spirit lives within the doll, greta begins to take the rules seriously.
remembering that the heelshires said brahms was shy, she realizes that the doll only moves when she isn't in the room with him; she demonstrates this to malcolm, who becomes worried. he informs greta that a girl brahms was friends with was found in the forest with her skull crushed. before the police could question brahms, the heelshires' house was burnt down with him in it. malcolm warns her not to stay, but greta, having previously suffered a miscarriage after being beaten by cole, feels obligated to care for brahms. elsewhere, the heelshires write a goodbye letter to brahms before drowning themselves.
one evening, cole arrives, intending to force greta back home. for greta's safety, malcolm stays nearby. greta asks the doll for help. cole wakes up and sees a message written in blood telling him to leave. believing it was done by either greta or malcolm, he angrily smashes the doll to pieces. the house begins to shake and they hear noises behind the walls. the mirror explodes; from a hole behind it emerges the real, now-adult brahms wearing a porcelain mask identical to the doll's face; after surviving the fire, brahms has been living in the walls of the house and is abnormal. brahms kills cole, then turns on malcolm and greta.
as they are pursued, greta and malcolm discover brahms' room; a doll made from greta's missing dress, hair, and jewelry sits in brahms' bed, and greta finds the goodbye letter from the heelshires, revealing their plan of leaving greta behind as a mate for brahms. brahms knocks out malcolm, threatening to kill him if greta leaves. greta is able to escape the house but returns to save malcolm. arming herself with a screwdriver, she invokes the rules and forces brahms to bed. he asks for a good night kiss; when he tries to kiss her, she stabs him. brahms tries to choke her but she pushes the weapon in deeper and he collapses. greta rescues malcolm and they escape the house.
later, someone is seen repairing the doll.
