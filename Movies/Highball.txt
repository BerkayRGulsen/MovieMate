== removal of credit ==
baumbach has removed his credit for the film, explaining in an interview with the a.v. club:

and it was a funny script. but it was just too ambitious. we didn't have enough time, we didn't finish it, it didn't look good, it was just a whole ... mess. [laughs.] we couldn't get it done, and i had a falling out with the producer. he abandoned it, and i had no money to finish it, to go back and maybe get two more days or something. then later, it was put out on dvd without my approval.
