according to director sivaram mony, matchbox is a coming-of-age story containing love, friendship and fun. it was shot in kozhikode. "matchbox, as the name suggests, is about how a few people fit perfectly in a box, or a society. though there are four main characters in the movie, matchbox is mainly about ambu," says sivaram. the film is about four friends and the strong bond they share. "while we paid tribute to the city through the movie, kozhikode and its unique slang helped us a lot in establishing the depth of friendship the characters share," says sivaram. matchbox was produced under the banner of revathy kalamandir.
