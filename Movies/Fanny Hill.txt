== critical reception ==
time out wrote, "a relatively large budget and some respectable names in the cast list, but this is still limp softcore flummery sold on the half-remembered notoriety of its purported 18th century source...lawyer reed and madam winters, meanwhile, seem as though they have their teeth gritted in the hope that it will all be over soon." 
sky movies wrote, "they should have made the script funnier, got kenneth williams and joan sims - and retitled it carry on fanny..."
