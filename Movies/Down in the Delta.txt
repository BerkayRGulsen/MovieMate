=== critical response ===
alfre woodard's work drew praise from san francisco chronicle reviewer peter stack, who lauded her for "a beautifully layered performance...woodard is magical as a single mother haunted by drugs, alcohol and an inadequate education. she almost single-handedly shores up this somewhat simplistic movie...[h]er instincts for drama and humor provide a welcome dose of human reality, saving a script that veers toward the sentimental."
