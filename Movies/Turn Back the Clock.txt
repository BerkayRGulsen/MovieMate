turn back the clock is a 1933 american pre-code mgm fantasy comedy-drama film directed by edgar selwyn, written by selwyn and ben hecht, and starring mae clarke and lee tracy (while under contract to metro-goldwyn-mayer). the three stooges featuring curly howard appear in an uncredited straight role as wedding singers. there is a small gag wherein lee tracy asks the stooges to sing "tony's wife", a song which the stooges have not heard before; moe howard then asks "tony's wife? who is she?" although they are not credited as the three stooges (indeed, they receive no screen credit at all), this marks the first time the trio appeared as a group on film without their former leader, ted healy. they would launch their long-running film-shorts career a few months later.

joe wakes to discover that he is a young man again. after scaring his mother (clara blandick) with talk of the future, and after having to face the doctor who asks him if he wants to go crazy like his father, he decides to keep his past life to himself. going to his job as a soda jerk, he meets elvina (peggy shannon). they soon become engaged. the engagement announcement crushes joe's girlfriend, mary, and his mother, who reminds him that money does not buy happiness.
after the wedding, joe becomes rich due to his knowledge of the future.  meanwhile, mary and ted, joes old friend, get married.  remembering the post war problems, joe pledges one million dollars to help returning vets. his wife is enraged, but president woodrow wilson hails joe as a hero and nominates him as the head of the war industry.  elvina openly mocks him, but they refuse to divorce to avoid scandal.
years pass and in 1929 joe goes into the cigar store and sees ted working there.  at dinner with ted and mary, joe offers ted the chance to invest $4,000 in a venture.  mary approves the idea, because she believes in joe.
