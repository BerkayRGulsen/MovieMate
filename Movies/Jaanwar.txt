while heading to the temple, badshah comes across the police informant who caused abdul's arrest. in a fit of rage, he kills him and flees when the police arrive. sapna, having been stood up at her own wedding, is mocked by her community. later that night, badshah finds a child who has survived a train crash, and goes to sapna for help. sapna mistakenly believes that badshah is a married man and has brought his own son to her. sapna's uncle calls the police, and badshah escapes with the child, without explaining the truth to sapna. meanwhile, the child's distraught parents, aaditya and mamta, struggle to deal with their son's disappearance. badshah attempts to leave the boy at a mosque, but later decides to adopt him. months pass by and abdul still refuses to cooperate with police. inspector pradhan refuses to close badshah's file, promising that he will neither accept any promotions or transfers until he is caught. badshah leaves his criminal life behind and starts a new, honest life as babu lohar. babu works hard to earn money to provide for the boy, who he names raju and raises as his own.
seven years later, raju has grown up and starts to attend school. mamta, who is the school's trustee, meets raju and bonds with him, not realising that he is her son. she showers him with gifts, which angers babu, as he feels that his son is being enticed away from him with material things. abdul is released from prison and goes home to sultan, who assumed that badshah was imprisoned as well. abdul concludes that badshah had stolen the money from the deal and abandoned him in jail. sultan calls for revenge and wants badshah to return to work for him. abdul tracks down sapna, who now works as a bar dancer in a nightclub, and finds out that she does not know where badshah is either. soon, abdul finds out about badshah's new identity and confronts him about the money and his disappearance. babu meets sultan and tells him to forget their past and leave him alone, but sultan refuses. having followed abdul, inspector pradhan arrives at babu's house and meets raju. he is impressed with the character of the young boy and decides not to pursue badshah anymore. after a school concert, aaditya gives raju a lift home and comes across his childhood pictures, causing him to realise that raju is his son. he invites babu to his home and pleads for the return of his son, but babu cannot bear to be separated from raju and refuses. abdul tries to persuade sapna to kill badshah to avenge her humiliation, but she is unable to do so after she overhears mamta pleading with babu to return her son. desperate for the return of his son, aaditya takes babu to court and wins the right to have raju in his and mamta's full custody. realising that their son is unhappy with his new life, aaditya and mamta take raju to visit babu, but he is kidnapped by sultan's men during the trip.
