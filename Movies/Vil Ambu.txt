== critical reception ==
rediff wrote "director ramesh may have failed to capitalise on an intelligent plot but vil ambu is an engaging thriller, well worth a watch." behindwoods wrote "director ramesh subramaniam has narrated an emotional story that doesn't lose the direction at any point. also the only problem in the story is its transparency, it becomes a challenge for the storyteller to retain the connect developed with the audience in the first half."
