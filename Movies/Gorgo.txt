== plot ==
captain joe ryan is salvaging for treasure off the coast of ireland when a volcano erupts, nearly sinking his ship. ryan and his first officer and friend, sam slade, take the ship to nara island for repairs. before the harbour master, mr  mccartin, arrives to assist them, the crew meet sean, an orphan, who assists mccartin: he invites them to see his collection of ancient viking relics. ryan finds himself intrigued by a relic bearing the image of a creature that sean calls "ogra, the sea spirit".
joe and sam consult the surly  mccartin and discover he has more than archaeological interest when he shows them his stash of illegally salvaged gold relics from the harbour. ryan warns him to stop being unhelpful or else he will call the police. as ryan's divers check the harbour for other divers who mysteriously disappeared, one of them emerges and dies from "fear". that night a group of fishermen go out to check the water. they are attacked by a gigantic creature, but successfully drive it off with firebrands.
after meeting the fishermen and with help from mccartin, ryan and his crew manage to capture the creature and haul it onto their ship. sean warns them that they have made a mistake, but the crew ignore him. hearing of the creature, two university scientists arrive to meet ryan and slade, hoping to obtain it for scientific study. however, ryan has already sold the creature to dorkin's circus in london.
dorkin names the creature "gorgo", after the gorgon medusa,  before transporting it to a large, enclosed pit for public exhibition in battersea park. ryan and slade meet the scientists again, who inform them the creature is an infant. with its larger mother still out there, the royal navy takes charge of the operation. later that night gorgo's mother emerges from the sea and attacks nara island in search of her offspring before leaving. when she attacks again in the morning, a royal navy destroyer intercepts her, but she proves immune to their weapons and sinks it, killing all aboard.
the mother later attacks london. the military intervene, but fail to stop or destroy her. ryan and slade split up to find sean, with the former finding the boy and keeping him safe. gorgo's mother is eventually reunited with her offspring and frees him from the pit before they both return safely to the sea.

== production ==
the film was originally intended to be set in japan as an homage to godzilla; the setting was then changed to france, and then finally to the british isles. according to bill warren's film book keep watching the skies, southern australia was also considered for a locale, but the producers supposedly decided that audiences "wouldn't care" if a monster attacked australia; its alleged lack of worldwide recognisable landmarks for gorgo to destroy was also cited as a consideration.
the location where gorgo first appears, the fictional nara island, is an anagram of the aran islands, off ireland's west coast. the exterior scenes set in ireland were filmed at bulloch harbour and coliemore harbour, both near the county dublin town of dalkey. other scenes were filmed at the mgm-british studios in borehamwood, hertfordshire.scenes where gorgo is driven through the streets of london were shot on a sunday morning, when there was little other traffic. the film studio wanted gorgo to fight the military, despite director eugne louri's objections.
gorgo's special effects were achieved by suitmation and miniaturisation, a technique pioneered in the godzilla films. the younger gorgo was smaller than most giant monsters, so the sets around him were built to a larger scale, leading to an enhanced sense of realism. the creatures were also shot with then-pricey slow-motion cameras to create a sense of scale. the effects were complex and are well respected by special effects artists and fans. the film is also sometimes praised for its innovative ending, in which, unusually for such films, the monsters survive and prevail.the film is one in which every (human) member of the cast is male, with females only visible in the crowd scenes in london.
