after collecting the ipads and deleting the videos, their friend's son, howard, threatens to upload a copy of their sex tape to youporn unless they give him $25,000. after failing to get the money, they break into the youporn headquarters and begin to destroy their web servers. their plan is quickly thwarted when an alarm sounds. the owner and his cronies confront them and threaten to call the police, but agree not to do so in exchange for $15,000 to cover the damage. he also removes their video and explains that all they had to do to have a video removed was send him an e-mail request for such removal.
after they have deleted all videos, howard comes over to the house and gives jay the only existing copy of the video on a usb flash drive in exchange for being allowed to hang out with their son, clive, since he is his only friend.
jay and annie decide to watch the video once themselves. afterwards, they take the usb flash drive containing the video and go outside to smash it with a hammer, blend it, burn it with fire, and bury the remains.
