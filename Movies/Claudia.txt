robert young said of his co-star, shed done it on broadway and this was mostly a photographed play. ina claire was wonderful as her mother. it did sensational business and fox requested a sequel. dorothy was aghast and said shed never do a sequel, but technically, she was under contract to selznick and he simply put his foot down and claudia and david duly appeared in 1946 and was almost as big a hit.
