== controversies ==
it is said that according to the initial script, amitabh bachchan had to die in the last scene. when rajesh khanna got to know this, he pressurized  hrishikesh mukherjee to change the ending so he dies in the end instead of amitabh bachchan. it was khanna's view that death in the end gets viewers' sympathy. the same had happened in anand, getting lot of popularity for khanna. although mukherjee did not want this change, khanna was such a big star, he had to do this. this made amitabh very angry and he vowed never to work with khanna again.
