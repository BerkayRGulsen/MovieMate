== plot ==
august "auggie" pullman is a 10-year-old boy living in a brownstone in brooklyn with his mother, isabel; father, nate; older sister, via; and dog, daisy. he was born with a rare medical facial deformity, which he refers to as "mandibulofacial dysostosis", and has undergone 27 surgeries in order to see, smell, speak and hear. auggie has been home-schooled, but as he approaches fifth grade, his parents decide to enroll him in beecher prep, a private school. before the school year begins, auggie meets with mr. tushman, the principal, who arranges a tour for him with three other students: jack, julian, and charlotte. when school starts, auggie is ostracized, but soon forms a close friendship with jack.
for halloween, auggie dresses in a ghostface mask and cloak from last year when he doesn't have enough time to change to the boba fett costume he was planning to wear. he walks through school upbeat and confident due to the anonymity his costume affords him. however, as he enters his homeroom, he overhears jack, who does not recognize him, joining julian and his friends amos, miles, and henry, in making fun of him behind his back by saying that "[he] would kill [himself] if [he] looked like auggie." he becomes sick, forcing his mother to abandon her mother-daughter day with via to bring him home. though she is hurt, via convinces auggie to go trick-or-treating with her, as she has been rejected by her best friend, miranda.
auggie forms a new friendship with a girl named summer and confides in her about his split with jack. when jack asks summer why auggie is avoiding him, she only gives him the clue "ghostface". realization soon dawns on him, and he resolves to partner with auggie instead of julian and amos for the school science fair to make it up to the former. when julian confronts jack in the hallway and calls auggie a freak, the two begin fighting, which is broken up by their homeroom teacher, mr. browne, and another teacher. after suspending jack for two days, mr. tushman reads jack's letter about defending auggie. jack then apologizes to auggie via minecraft, telling auggie he said what he said only to gain favor with julian's friend group, and they reconcile.
meanwhile, via signs up for her schools drama club after meeting a boy named justin, with whom she soon begins a romantic relationship. via is selected as miranda's understudy for the lead role in the school's production of our town, but on opening night, miranda learns that via's family is in attendance while her own is not, so she feigns illness in order to let via take her place. via gives a moving performance that earns her a standing ovation, and she and miranda reconcile.
auggie's popularity and circle of friends grow bigger over the course of the year, especially after he and jack win the science fair, but he continues to be harassed by julian and his friends until mr. browne notices. mr. tushman later confronts julian and his parents with the evidence, including hate notes and a class picture with auggie photoshopped out. julian's mother admits that she was the one who deleted auggie from the picture, defends julian's actions, and asserts that the students should not be exposed to auggie. despite her threats to pull their funding from the school, mr. tushman suspends julian for two days, forcing him to miss an upcoming nature retreat. as they leave, julian becomes distraught when his mom declares he will not be back in the fall; he apologizes to mr. tushman.
at the nature retreat, auggie and jack are threatened by a trio of seventh graders from another school, but amos, miles, and henry defend the two.
at the year-end graduation ceremony, auggie thanks his mom for enrolling him in school. isabel tells him "you really are a wonder, auggie." auggie is given the henry ward beecher medal for his strength and courage throughout the school year. the movie ends with everyone cheering auggie as he delivers a voiceover narration telling the viewers (and quoting the last precept mr. browne gave in class) "be kind, for everyone is fighting a hard battle. and if you really want to see what people are, all you have to do is look."
