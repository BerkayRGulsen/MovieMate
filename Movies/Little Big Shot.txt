== critical reception ==
sky movies noted, "another reminder of how much the world of british comedy has missed the abrasive cockney wit of ronald shiner. here he plays the soft-hearted son of a famous crook who tries to emulate his father. alas, he's too nice to be a criminal, and the gang only keep him out of respect for his old man. digby wolfe, once a familiar television face on panel games and reviews, and later creator of laugh-in, scores as an impecunious journalist ever on the look-out for a scoop."
