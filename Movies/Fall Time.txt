== critical reception ==
although it was nominated for the grand jury prize at sundance film festival (it lost to the brothers mcmullen), it never got domestic distribution in the united states.
todd mccarthy of variety did not care for the film:

there's material here for a film, at most, half the length of fall time, a thoroughly pedestrian crime drama.
