== reception ==
from retrospective reviews, sight & sound described the film as "pure exploitation" and that "there are a fair number of arty flourishes: expressionistic lighting and make up effects, theatrically stylised sets and gymnastic camerawork."  the magazine commented on any feminist reading of the film, noting that any suggestion of a "feminist critique of patriarchal society" is "hard to reconcile with the sustained, glib emphasis on female torment." video watchdog described female convict #701 scorpion as "inferior to its follow-up female convict scorpion-jailhouse 41", noting that it is "largely set-bound and lacking grandeur and poetry of its sequel"
