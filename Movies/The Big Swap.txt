== reception ==
brendan kelly of variety wrote, "partner-swapping may be a catchy concept to start with, but the big swap simply isn't sexy enough, nor does it have enough post-coital emotional resonance to maintain interest over its two-hour running time."  jessica mellor of empire rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "even with lots of shagging and some hilariously cringe-making moments, the climax ironically comes much too soon and leaves the viewer feeling frustrated rather than satisfied."  total film rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "[t]his low-budget brit flick fails to ignite, held back by rudimentary production values and bland characters."
