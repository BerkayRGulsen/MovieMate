== reception ==
baradwaj rangan of hindu wrote "jackson durai only sounds like a horror comedy  the plot is more intricate, it wants to do more than just make you laugh, scream. it actually wants to tell some kind of story, a groundhog day-like story that keeps looping back on itself, each iteration the opportunity for a change." sify wrote "dharani dharans ideology of mixing fantasy, horror and spoof is laudable but he hasnt got the right screenplay. although all the actors are capable of pulling off the characters given to them, the aimless screenplay doesnt offer big entertainment." behindwoods wrote "overall the director seems to have tried his best at giving us an entertaining feature but instead cluelessly heads in a direction which lacks a sense of purpose. he handles a texture that is not definite and weaves a rather loose structure around it." times of india wrote "the film is a horror comedy, a genre that is very much the trend today, and going by the director's previous film, you expect at least a competently made film that keeps us entertained. but the only thing that we have in store is disappointment." top10cinema wrote "definitely, a different horror tale, but lacks engagement."
