== plot ==
three years after winning their first championship, the barden bellas are now led by senior beca mitchell and three-time super senior chloe beale. the bellas have been the icca national champions for three consecutive years. however, a national scandal (dubbed "muffgate") erupts when patricia "fat amy" hobart accidentally rips her pants in front of u.s. president barack obama during his birthday performance at the kennedy center, exposing her genitalia due to her lack of underwear. the incident leads to the bellas' suspension from the iccas. 
however, they are not stripped of their competitive titles, leading beca to make a deal that they can be reinstated should they win the acapella world championship. freshman emily junk begins her college career, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her mother, katherine, by becoming a bella. at orientation, she watches an acapella performance by the treblemakers, now led by beca's boyfriend jesse swanson. jesse' best friend, benjamin "benji" applebaum, develops a crush on emily at first sight. the bellas learn that das sound machine (dsm), a german powerhouse group, has replaced them on their victory tour and is the favorite to win the worlds. additionally, beca has started an internship at recording studio residual heat, something only jesse knows (and fat amy later discovers).
as the bellas suspension means they cannot hold auditions, emily goes directly to their sorority house. she sings her unfinished song "flashlight," impressing them; they decide she can join, as since she came of her own accord, they technically arent breaking any rules.the bellas meet dsm when the latter performs at a car show; the group, led by intimidating duo pieter krmer and kommissar, takes delight in mocking the bellas. later, both groups are invited to an exclusive riff-off; also in attendance are the treblemakers, the tone hangers (a group composed of former treblemakers, including previous leader bumper allen, with whom amy is in a no-strings-attached relationship), and the green bay packers. 
the bellas make it to the final two, but lose to dsm when emily panics and sings "flashlight", violating the tradition of singing non-original songs. bumper surprises amy with a traditional date and asks her to officially be his girlfriend; she refuses, leaving him devastated. at a practice performance for the worlds, the bellas' planned set ends in disaster when their incorporation of pyrotechnics sets cynthia rose's hair on fire. in order to rediscover their roots and synchronicity, chloe takes them to a retreat led by former bella aubrey posen. the truth about becas internship comes out, and she starts a heated debate with chloe over her obsession with the group and accuses the other bellas of not thinking about their futures. she angrily storms off, only to step into one of the camps hidden bear traps. in a panic, she apologises for her harsh words, before being saved by lilly. later, the bellas accept that they must go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing "when i'm gone", the song beca used to audition for the group. 
amy realizes she regrets ending things with bumper, and the two reconcile the next day. meanwhile, beca's boss at her internship has been unimpressed with everything she has presented to him so far, so beca offers to help emily produce "flashlight" at the studio to demonstrate her true abilities. when they show him the demo, he expresses envy for their talent and says he looks forward to working with them.the senior bellas graduate, and the group heads to copenhagen for the world finals. before their performance, emily and benji share a kiss. the bellas deliver a stellar stripped-down performance, ending in a harmonized version of "flashlight" with aubrey, katherine, and other past bellas joining in. they win the championship, repairing their damaged legacy. as the senior bellas leave barden, they give emily a belated initiation ceremony, with amy demonstrating the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase. in a mid-credits scene, bumper performs "all of me" on the voice, chooses christina aguilera as his coach and makes her uncomfortable by giving her a lengthy hug.

=== critical response ===
on rotten tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 65% based on 217 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. the site's critical consensus reads, "pitch perfect 2 sings in sweet comedic harmony, even if it doesn't hit quite as many high notes as its predecessor." on metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "a" on an a+ to f scale.leslie felperin of the hollywood reporter wrote: "reprising the kind of musical performances, campus hijinks, stinging humor and sassy sisterhood put in place by its eminently likeable predecessor, pitch perfect 2 remixes the elements and comes up with something even slicker and sharper."
guy lodge of variety called it an "ebulliently entertaining, arguably superior sequel to the 2012 musical comedy hit." also: "kay cannons script is even lighter on narrative than its predecessor, but fills any resulting void with a concentrated supply of riotous gags, and a renewed emphasis on the virtues of female collaboration and independence." 
peter travers of rolling stone gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. travers welcomed the addition of steinfeld, praised wilson for her continued scene stealing, and said the scenes with keegan-michael key were gold. he reserved his highest praise for banks, for both her acting and her feature debut as director, praising her for "bringing fizz to the tiredest clichs and reveling in a screen full of musical girl power."richard roeper of the chicago sun-times gave it a mixed review, saying "pitch perfect 2 strains to find some plot conflicts while balancing the line between satire and rousing musical numbers." michael phillips of the chicago tribune called it "a two-hour lesson in how to act like a frenemy to your alleged friends. and it's not funny enough." 
david edelstein of new york magazine gave the film a negative review and despite having reviewed the first film positively thought the sequel was "a ca-terrible". edelstein was critical of the script, "there are good ideas that needed another pass", and 
kendrick's performance "ive never seen her so flat-out bad  distracted, depressed, conviction-less" although he does concede that the climactic number was excellent.
rodrigo perez at indiewire wrote "the movie's off-color humor also doesn't connect like it once did either. the casual racism, homophobia and sexism might be tolerable if any of it was remotely funny, but none of it is."
kevin fallon of the daily beast liked the film but was critical of the "tone-deaf racial jokes" particularly the casual racism of the subplot about the guatemalan singer. he also did not find the racially charged jokes from the commentators funny.
