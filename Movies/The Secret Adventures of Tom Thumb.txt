== plot ==
inside an artificial insemination factory, a mechanical wasp hovering around the establishment is crushed to death by the machinery's gears, causing its vitals to drop into one of the jars on the conveyor belt. this results in a woman giving birth to a thumb-sized fetus-like child in her and her husband's house in a grim and slum urban town. outside, a man in a black suit witnesses the whole scene and goes to an alley to encounter pa thumb, who picks up a ventriloquist box-shaped doll house to make his son's bedroom. the man simply grins at the him but leaves when he gets creeped out by the ventriloquist's dummy at the window of a toy shop.
pa and ma thumb raise their son and decide to call him "tom thumb".


== production ==
the secret adventures of tom thumb was made using a combination of stop-motion animation and pixilation (live actors posed and shot frame-by-frame), often with live actors and puppets sharing the frame. it was originally commissioned as a 10-minute short for bbc2's christmas programming, but was rejected for being too dark for the festive season. the short version nevertheless garnered critical acclaim through showings at animation festivals, and a feature-length version was commissioned by the bbc a year later.
