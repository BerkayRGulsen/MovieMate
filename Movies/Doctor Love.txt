== critical reception ==
rediff.com gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 and said "dr love is yet another campus film". sify also rated the movie at 2/5 and said "dr.love tries to present all those masala once again, but it looks amateurish to the core. watch it at your own risk please". indiaglitz  said "all in all, 'dr.love' has some interesting moments and the ensemble star cast pitches in real performances too. on the whole, the movie could be an ideal popcorn flick targeted to strike a chord with the youth and those who relish candy floss and madcap entertainers. if you are not looking for wisdom and rationale in a light-hearted entertainer, we are sure you will savour this campus carnival" and gave 2.75 stars out of 5.
