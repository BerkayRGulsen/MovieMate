== plot ==
alvin johnson (nick cannon) is an extremely intelligent nerd skilled in designing car engines. he has also taken up a job as a pool cleaner, to raise money to buy a camshaft and to build an engine for a scholarship project that will ensure him a full ride to the school of his choice. alvin has always dreamed of hanging out with the popular kids, especially paris morgan (christina milian), a beautiful, popular black cheerleader dating nba star dru hilton (elimu nelson). when paris crashes her mother's expensive suv during an argument with dru, alvin agrees to repair the car using the money he had earned for his project, jeopardizing his scholarship opportunity, in which paris pays him back by giving him a $1,500 makeover.
after a few missteps, alvin begins to ingratiate himself with the popular crowd. he and paris grow closer as she shares with him her secret love of music and he shares with her that he knows how to build car engines. paris begins to develop feelings for alvin and at the end of their two-week dating period, she tries to hint that she would like to kiss him. however, alvin misinterprets her and goes along with their original plan of a public break up at school.
even after the break up, alvin continues to grow in popularity, alienating his former nerdy friends and dating paris's friends. paris is unhappy to realize how shallow and vapid her friends are, and by extension, alvin. tired of him constantly ditching them in favor of the popular kids, alvin's friends confront him on the matter, during which alvin's sister aretha overhears. she comes to the conclusion that alvin paid paris to date her, she tells their parents who attempt to talk to alvin, but he blows them off.
at the end of the year on senior ditch day, paris asks alvin to hang out as real friends, but a newly egotistical alvin insults her. they argue and storm off from each other. dru is also at the party to reconcile with paris and is unimpressed that she has been dating alvin. in an attempt to win dru back, paris admits her deal with alvin to the school, returning alvin back to mediocrity. now back to being unpopular, alvin finally realizes he does not have the crankshaft for his project.
alvin's father clarence (steve harvey) pays for the crankshaft, telling alvin that they will work out a plan later to pay him back while also explaining to alvin that he'd supported his sudden transformation because he wanted alvin to have the same experiences he did while he was in high school, seeing as he was one of the most popular guys at his school. he also admits that he didn't have alvin's brains or potential but he's always been proud of his son. with this confidence restored, alvin builds an engine with the part his dad bought. alvin's friends push the broken car they had been working on into the garage. they congratulate him on a job well done on completing the engine but are still angry with him for blowing them off. alvin sees that their car needs a new engine so he installs the one he just built to restore their car, telling them to let him have it sometime within that next week so he can present it to the scholarship committee. alvin's friends forgive him.
together, they all attend a school basketball game where alvin stands up for his nerd friends against the basketball players. alvin finally redeems himself in front of everyone and his friends become friendly with the popular crowd. alvin leaves the gymnasium, and as paris follows him out, she is stopped by dru. paris blows him off and chases after alvin. they finally kiss and agree to date.
in a deleted scene, 6 months have passed by and it is shown that alvin & paris are attending an open mic night. it is revealed that alvin got into princeton while paris decided to pursue her dreams of being an r&b singer.
