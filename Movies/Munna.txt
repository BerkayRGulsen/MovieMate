=== critical reception ===
idle brain rated 3/5 stated the movie starts off on a dull note and meanders aimlessly till the dark secret is revealed before interval. the flashback episode is unappealing. there are a couple of surprises in the second half. the plus points of the film are prabhas, stylish taking of the director and lavish budget. on the flip side, screenplay and narration should have been better. there is no holistic perspective in the film. let us wait and see if dil raju's 'midas touch' works for this film or not! fullhyd states munna is perhaps worth a watch for those seeking a testosterone high. its fate depends less on its own merit and more on the kind of competing attractions at the box office in future weeks. cinegoer.com rated 2.75/5 stated the movie has a lot of style, but lacks the necessary soul and substance. swanky visuals, crisp narration, a demigod like hero and two major twists fail to elevate the movie's average viewing status.  telugu cinema rates 2.5/5 stated there is not much entertainment in the film. the romance between prabhas and illeana was not properly developed. too much of action is the undoing factor for this film.
no one really said this but still - this has the most cringiest and lamest fight scenes ever, like the scene where he is attached by goons in a car with guns, is really lame.
