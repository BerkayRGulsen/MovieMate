== marketing ==
warner bros. promoted so big provocatively and scandalously in its advertising, even associating the title of the movie with pervus's manhood through a picture of sterling hayden grasping jane wyman's shoulders as she looks up at him captioned "he stood there so big. love had come come...intense, unashamed...she was ready to forget she'd ever been a lady."
on october 27, 1953, warner bros. also put on a "carriage trade" premiere of so big at the hollywood paramount theatre. true to its name, at least 23 of the fanciest horse-drawn carriages on the west coast transported the stars and actors to the theater along hollywood boulevard for publicity.warner bros. also provided trade showings of so big on wednesday, september 30, 1953, around a month before it would be released. some cities for the showings included boston, chicago, des moines, detroit, indianapolis, kansas city, milwaukee, minneapolis, new haven, omaha, philadelphia, pittsburgh, st. louis, and washington.


== critical reception ==
bosley crowther of the new york times wrotedespite the fact that the story is "dated," that it offers a very familiar theme and that the present production is loaded with some typical "hollywood" flaws, there is still a great deal of solid substance in this latest retelling of the tale ...for the better part of the picture, we are largely indebted to jane wyman...remarkably strong and effective in every forthright little bit she does. from her earliest appearance...to her ultimate poignant scene...she is humble, restrained and sure...where the picture falls down is in those phases in which the grown-up son goes to chicago and gets himself infected with false notions of a successful career. here john twist's adaptation and mr. wise's direction are unsure, and the acting by all and sundry has a specious and artificial quality...as a consequence of its downward tangent toward the end, the whole picture loses force. the poignance of the mother's disappointment in her dearly loved son goes awry. even so, the performance of miss wyman holds up right through to the end, and the character she sets throughout the first part stands firm amid the flow of glycerin tears.
radio times rated the film three out of five stars and commented "the tale's a mite old-fashioned for today's tastes, but under skilled editor-turned-director robert wise the warner bros gloss is not too intrusive, and there are nicely honed performances from big sterling hayden and lovely nancy olsen in support."tv guide rated the film three out of four stars and added "a good production, but a bit inflated, so big commits the same error as the 1932 picture in that it stuffs a quarter of a century and many characters into not enough time."the general federation of women's clubs (gfwc) had a special preview in washington of the highly influential group in 1953, and it was a big hit with the toppers. according to mrs. dean gray edwards, chairman of the m.p. division of the federation, they were "enchanted with the splendid filming of the edna ferber novel. several said they had never seen a finer picture and that this is the type of picture greatly needed today." the millions of women who create the federation will receive that message, and the independent exhibitors film bulletin claims that will assure a pre-sold audience. they also recommend a similar preview for all feminist types of movies to women's groups.on october 3, 1953, harrison's reports wrote "despite its length, this remake of edna ferber's prize-winning novel is only a fair drama...the trouble with this third version is that it lacks unity of plot -- it wanders all over the lot, and is packed with details which, for the most part, are tiresome. another drawback is the fact that the spectator feels sympathy for the boy characters in the first half of the picture, but finds it difficult to transfer his affections to them in the second half, where they are shown as grown men. still another weakness is the fact that the farm background in the first half of the picture is drab and dreary. no fault can be found with jane wyman's acting: she can always be depended on to do her part right. there is some human interest here and there, and some mild comedy, but with a better script  the picture might have been a powerful drama. the black-and-white photography is fair:--on october 5, 1953, independent exhibitors film bulletin rated so big as good, with three dollar signs out of four, four being "tops." the review headlines with "new version of edna ferber novel filmization well-fashioned tear-jerker. wyman performance ranks with her "johnny belinda" role. strong fem appeal. fine family attraction. will build on word-of-mouth." the review states "success of previous two (1925, 1932) versions of ferber novel, plus jane wyman name and formidable word-of-mouth makes "so big" good b.o. bet, except, perhaps, in action houses. wyman's superb performance, matches blue veil and johnny belinda portrayals, makes bid for oscar nomination...roles are excellently portrayed, interest held throughout, no mean feat in episodic tale of this sort, plenty of sure-fire angles and incidents to wet eyes, and bring a warm glow. family spots will thrive on it."
