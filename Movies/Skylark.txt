== reception ==
in a contemporary review, variety magazine opined, "picture carries several basic changes in story structure from samson raphaelsons original tale which appeared as a 'saturday evening post' serial, a book, and play. but revisions are decidedly advantageous in the transposition to the screen.
under skillful guidance of mark sandrich as producer-director, (the) story unfolds at a zestful pace, accentuating the comedic episodes to the utmost. claudette colberts performance of the wife (stage role created by gertrude lawrence), around whom the motivation revolves, is of high merit, and player takes advantage of every line and situation for delightful exposition. ray milland is topnotch as the business-absorbed advertising executive; brian aherne catches attention as the suave other man."film reviewer hal erickson, noted, "(that) 'skylark's comic highlight is a slapstick sequence in which colbert tries to prepare lunch in a yacht during a storm. the scene was shot in a single take, an accomplishment in which the actress took justifiable pride."
