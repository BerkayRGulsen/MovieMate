== production ==
the film was originally known as beach pad. it was based on an original script by jack sher and irene kamp, who had worked on paris blues together; they sold it to martin jurow and richard shepherd, the producers of breakfast at tiffany's, who had a deal at paramount.shooting started in november 1960 and took place in hollywood and on location in balboa.fabian and tommy sands were both pop stars at the time and both sing in the film. sands' hair was dyed blonde to differentiate him from fabian. sands later said this was "a big mistake. it looked so phony. fans who knew me knew that was phony."


=== songs ===
"love in a goldfish bowl" by burt bacharach and hal david sung by tommy sands (a capitol records release)
"you're only young once" by russell faith, robert marcucci and peter de angelis sung by fabian (a chancellor records artist)


== reception ==
the new york times called the film "vapid and transparent" but that at least it "made no pretenses".producer martin jurow later said the film "didn't come off very well."according to a review of the film in diabolique magazine:

it's very possible to do a gay reading of this film, with sands displaying zero sexual interest in michaels or any woman throughout the film. or maybe that's too limiting: because when fabian puts the hard word on michaels, she is very coy and not keen at all, despite flirting heavily with him until then. so maybe it's more accurate to describe this movie as being about two people with low sex drives who find each other.
a novelisation of the script was issued in 1961.
