=== manga ===
the first arc was serialized in weekly shnen king (shnen gahosha). it depicts cyborg 009's origin story, the escape from black ghost, and the group running from the cyborg assassins. it ended with the battle against the mythos cyborgs.
the second arc, called the underground empire yomi arc, appeared in weekly shnen magazine (kodansha) alongside the release of the film version. the story is highly influenced by edgar rice burroughs' earth's core series, including an expedition to the center of the earth with a drill tank and a reptile race who can use telepathy and grow wings. the story ends with the final battle against black ghost. in the final scene, 009 and 002 fall into earth's atmosphere and are seen as a shooting star by two small children, one of whom wishes for a toy gun and the other for world peace (a scene reminiscent of ray bradbury's kaleidoscope). as such, 001 was able to use his telekinetic powers at the last minute to retrieve 002 and 009 from their plummet before death.
the third arc, serialized in monthly bouken-oh (adventure king) (akita shoten), contained 6 story arcs, including the monster island arc, the middle east arc, and the angels arc. the series abruptly ended during the angels arc.
the fourth arc, called the battle of the gods arc, was serialized in com (mushi production). ishinomori resumed and retold the interrupted angels arc with a new plot, but the series once again ended abruptly. ishinomori would not resume the series for a few years after this.
the fifth arc was serialized in shjo comic (shogakukan), and included the wind city arc, the snow carnival arc, and the edda arc. the story deals with legendary and mythical like characters challenging the 00 number cyborgs.
the sixth arc followed closely after the fifth arc. arcs such as the deinonychus arc (appeared in monthly shnen jump (shueisha)) and green hole arc (appeared in play comic (akita shoten)) were depicted, then long after, the underwater pyramid arc was serialized in monthly manga shnen (asahi sonorama).
the seventh arc was serialized in weekly shnen sunday (shogakukan) alongside the revival anime. a long arc consisting of many short arcs, this series dealt with the battle against neo black ghost as well as the emotional trauma of the 00 number cyborgs. the story is set approximately 20 years after the yomi arc, and the personalities and conduct of the cyborgs are depicted as more adult.
the eighth arc was serialized in monthly comic nora (gakken). this longer arc was called people drifting through time and space arc, and is a sequel to the immigration arc. the count of st. germain from the underwater pyramid arc appears, but the design of his drawing is different.
