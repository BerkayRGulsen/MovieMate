the film opened to high  negative reviews with sify.com  praising ajith and asin's performance but criticized the plot of the movie by labelling it as  a "built on a predictable premise" . another critic described the film as "below average" citing that "the biggest drawback is that the story does not have a strong plot or surprising twists and that "there is also a palpable lack of chemistry between the characters and this gives the picture a poorly contrived feel." rediff.com's review concluded that "sella's directorial debut lacks originality and is a hotch potch of celebrated scripts of the past. the film was a very big flop at the box office and was considered as the one of the worst movies in ajith kumar's career."the producers later dubbed and released the film in telugu as avatharudu and hindi as mera farz (2009), with both versions going unnoticed.the director of the film, chella, has not directed a film since despite announcing two other films, neruppu kozhi with sakthi and por vaal with jeevan.
