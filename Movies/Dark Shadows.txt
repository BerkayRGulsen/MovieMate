== plot ==
in 1760, young barnabas collins and his wealthy family set sail from liverpool to the new world, establishing the town of collinsport in maine and their grand estate, collinwood. fifteen years later, barnabas spurns the advances of his servant, angelique, secretly a witch. she murders his parents with dark magic and curses barnabas out of jealousy so that "all he loves will die". under the spell, his fiance josette falls from a cliff to her death; barnabas throws himself after her but survives, further cursed by angelique to eternal suffering as a vampire. angelique turns the town against barnabas, and buries him alive.
in 1972, maggie evans, who bears an uncanny resemblance to josette, travels to collinwood to fill the position of governess. she assumes the name victoria winters, and meets the dysfunctional collins descendants: matriarch elizabeth; her brother roger; her teenage daughter carolyn; roger's young son david, who believes he sees his late mother's ghost; and live-in psychiatrist dr. hoffman. that night, victoria is visited by the ghost of josette.
a construction crew building a mcdonald's unwittingly frees barnabas from his tomb; he apologetically feeds on their blood, and makes his way to collinwood, perplexed by the modern-day technology and fashion he encounters. at the manor, he hypnotizes the caretaker willie into his service, and reveals to elizabeth that the legends of her long-lost ancestor are true. barnabas asks to rejoin the family, and shows elizabeth the manor's secret passages and hidden treasure. though wary, she introduces him to the family as a distant relative from england with plans to reclaim the collins fortune.
elizabeth and barnabas use his powers of persuasion and the family treasure to restore the collins canning company and collinwood to its former glory, as barnabas adjusts to modern life and falls for victoria. angelique, having survived through the centuries and now owner of rival angel bay seafood, is still in love with barnabas; to protect victoria, barnabas gives in to angelique's lust and they have gravity-defying sex in her office. afterward, a remorseful barnabas again rejects angelique's love.
barnabas hosts a "happening" at collinwood for the entire town with alice cooper as entertainment. he finds victoria, who reveals that she has seen the ghost of josette her entire life; her parents committed her to an asylum, but she escaped and was drawn to collinwood. she returns barnabas' affections and they kiss, to angelique's dismay.
dr. hoffman learns of barnabas' true nature, and offers to drain his blood in search of a cure. he discovers her using the transfusions to de-age herself, and kills her. he confronts the greedy roger and offers him a choice: to become a better father to david, or to leave collinwood with enough money to live out his life elsewhere; roger chooses the latter. heartbroken, david is nearly struck by a falling disco ball, but barnabas saves him with supernatural speed and catches fire in the daylight, revealing himself as a vampire to the shocked household.
desperate, barnabas meets with angelique, who goads him into confessing to his murders, and demands he join her as her paramour. barnabas refuses, and is again trapped in a coffin. angelique destroys the collins cannery and, with a recording of barnabas' confession, rallies the town against the family. david frees barnabas, who confronts angelique at collinwood. they battle, and angelique enchants the house to turn against the family, despite the efforts of a shotgun-wielding elizabeth and carolyn, who outs herself as a werewolf. angelique reveals that she was responsible for the werewolf that bit carolyn as an infant and for the deaths of david's mother and barnabas' parents. the ghost of david's mother incapacitates angelique, and the household escapes the burning manor. angelique offers barnabas her heart, which crumbles as she dies.
he races to the cliff and finds victoria, unwilling to live as a mortal with him, but he refuses to turn her into a vampire. she steps off the cliff, and he leaps after her, biting her as they plummet to the ground. victoria awakens in barnabas arms as a vampire, declaring herself josette, and they passionately embrace.
the camera pans to dr. hoffman's corpse in the ocean, whose eyes suddenly flash open.

=== critical response ===
on rotten tomatoes, dark shadows holds an approval rating of 36% based on 252 reviews, with an average rating of 5.34/10. the site's critical consensus reads: "the visuals are top notch but tim burton never finds a consistent rhythm, mixing campy jokes and gothic spookiness with less success than other johnny depp collaborations." on metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "b" on an a+ to f scale.some critics felt that the film lacked a focused or consistent plot or genre (as either horror, comedy or drama) pointing to grahame-smith's script, and that some jokes fell flat. some further claimed that tim burton and johnny depp's collaborations have become tired. many of the same, and other reviewers, however, noted its visual style was impressive.positive reviewers, on the other hand, opined that the film did successfully translate the mood of the soap opera, also acclaiming the actorsmost notably depp as barnabas, who several said was the stand-out character due to his humorous culture shock, as well as pfeifferand their characters; and further, that the film's '70s culture pastiche worked to its advantage.roger ebert said, "[the film] offers wonderful things, but they aren't what's important. it's as if burton directed at arm's length, unwilling to find juice in the story." ebert later noted that "much of the amusement comes from depp's reactions to 1970s pop culture," eventually concluding that the film "begins with great promise, but then the energy drains out," giving it two and a half stars out of four. manohla dargis, writing for the new york times, said that it "isn't among mr. burton's most richly realized works, but it's very enjoyable, visually sumptuous and, despite its lugubrious source material and a sporadic tremor of violence, surprisingly effervescent," and opined in a mostly positive review that burton's "gift for deviant beauty and laughter has its own liberating power."rolling stone's peter travers gave the film a mixed two and a half stars, claiming, "after a fierce and funny start, dark shadows simply spins its wheels," and adding that "the pleasures of dark shadows are frustratingly hit-and-miss. in the end, it all collapses into a spectacularly gorgeous heap." in the washington post, ann hornaday dismissed the film, awarding it just one and a half stars, explaining that "burton's mash-up of post-'60s kitsch and modern-day knowingness strikes a chord that is less self-aware than fatally self-satisfied. dark shadows doesn't know where it wants to dwell: in the eerie, subversive penumbra suggested by its title or in playful, go-for-broke camp."richard corliss in time pointed out that "[burton]'s affection is evident, and his homage sometimes acute," and reasoned: "all right, so burton has made less a revival of the old show than a hit-or-miss parody pageant," but praised the star power of the film, relenting that "attention must be paid to movie allure, in a star like depp and his current harem. angelique may be the only demonic among the women here, but they're all bewitching." peter bradshaw, in the british newspaper the guardian, weighed the film in a mixed write-up, giving it three stars out of five, and pointing out his feeling that "the gothy, jokey 'darkness' of burton's style is now beginning to look very familiar; he has built his brand to perfection in the film marketplace, and it is smarter and more distinctive than a lot of what is on offer at the multiplex, but there are no surprises. there are shadows, but they conceal nothing."

== cancelled sequel ==
in december 2011, pfeiffer told mtv that she was hoping sequels would be made for the film. on may 8 of the following year, various tabloids like variety reported that warner bros. may have wanted to turn dark shadows into a film franchise. on the same day, collider mentioned that the ending lends itself to a possible sequel. when burton was asked if he thought that this could be a possible start to a franchise, he replied, "no. because of the nature of it being like a soap opera, that was the structure. it wasn't a conscious decision. first of all, it's a bit presumptuous to think that. if something works out, that's one thing, but you can't ever predict that. [the ending] had more to do with the soap opera structure of it."
