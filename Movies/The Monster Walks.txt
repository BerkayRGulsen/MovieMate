dr. clayton visits robert's room, and robert regains consciousness. he tells clayton about the plan he and hanns had to murder ruth, so that the estate would go to them instead. clayton rushes out to find ruth and warn her. she has already been taken by hanns to the basement though, where he attempts to force the ape to kill her. the ape turns on him instead, killing him. clayton arrives to find ruth alive and well.
