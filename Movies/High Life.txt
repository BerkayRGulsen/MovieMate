== plot ==
in 1983, visit from his former sociopathic cellmate bug (stephen eric mcintyre) has led to dick (timothy olyphant) being fired from his job as a hospital janitor. unemployed and in need of fast cash dick gets the idea to rob one of the brand new atms, to "buy a little self-respect," announces dick to bug and the team. enter the charismatic, criminally-minded donnie, (joe anderson) and the front-man, the sexy, sleepy-eyed charmer billy, (rossif sutherland) and all of the pieces are in place. "it's a precision job," says dick the night before the heist: "no violence."
things do not go according to plan and the unfolding catalogue of disasters that confronts dick is enough to test any friends loyalties as they bungle their way toward a pipe-dream of quick riches.
