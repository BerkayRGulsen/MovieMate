(2003). regarding the same, vaitla said "i saw good bye, lenin! when the scripting of dookudu was 50 per cent complete. it was a coincidence. i had the idea of showing mahesh in a new way as a young mla. i also had the idea of the father. then, gopimohan came in, and we worked on the script for seven months. it's a multi-layered film and writing the screenplay for it was tough." he added that the idea of how lies are told and you get people to believe them was already shown in his earlier film ready (2008).he chose a father-son relationship in the film as he wanted to show the emotions between them. apart from that, vaitla was inspired by other small things from good bye, lenin!. one such inspired sequence is where the protagonist and his team create fake news broadcasts and newspapers for showing them to his father to make the drama believable which includes making n. t. rama rao the prime minister of india in 2011. and, the scene where the protagonist lies to his father about few things without knowing that the latter is aware of the drama is inspired from the climax of good bye, lenin!.a reviewer from sify felt that some of the scenes and characters are inspired by babu's previous films athadu (2005) and pokiri (2006) apart from the hindi patiala house (2011). in one of the comedy scenes, m. s. narayana is seen performing spoofs of yamadonga (2007), magadheera (2009), simha (2010) and enthiran (2010). according to k. moti gokulsing and wimal dissanayake, authors of the book routledge handbook of indian cinemas, the parodies too received positive response.

=== critical reception ===
suresh kavirayani of the times of india rated it 4 out of 5 and wrote "dookudu is a typical srinu vytla film with a generous sprinkling of comedy. his narrative manages to keep the audience engaged until the end of the movie. this movie comes as a blessing for not just mahesh babu, but also for tollywood, which is badly in need of a hit, after the recent spate of box office debacles. srinu vytla and mahesh babu have come out with a winner in dookudu". bollywood life stated "dookudu has all the elements of a potboiler  the unholy nexus between underworld and politicos, passionate romance, shrill revenge and the glory of father-son relationship. the movie is almost certain to make a box office splash, but if fans are expecting the lofty fizz of pokkiri, perhaps there is some disappointment in store". sify called the film "entertaining" and wrote "despite the drawbacks, dookudu holds the power to lure the crowds, with its commercial values. it is a bonanza to mahesh babu's fans and it will not disappoint the family crowds either." ians rated it 3.5 out of 5 and stated "dookudu is a treat for mahesh's fans. but others can also enjoy this film for its comedy elements and mahesh's powerful presence." vanshika devuni of upperstall.com wrote "the best thing about the movie is that it comes across as a mass entertainer and makes no attempts to come across as a intellectual movie or a movie that tries to pretend it is 'hatke'."in contrast, b. v. s. prakash of deccan chronicle rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote "although, it is a tale of an honest cop who is on the trail of a dreaded don, director sinu vaitla relies on a band of comedians like brahmanandam and m.s. narayana to sustain audience interests, before his protagonist accomplishes his mission. audiences have to leave behind their thinking caps at home to enjoy this comic-caper since the screenplay has few gaping holes and is repetitive as well." pavithra srinivasan of rediff gave it 2.5 out of 5 and criticised the film's screenplay and logic-defying sequences, but praised babu's performance, calling his role a "cakewalk" and recommending the film for his fans in particular. ramchander of oneindia entertainment wrote "to sum up, dookudu is just another average entertainer and not in the same league as mahesh babu"s earlier blockbusters like athadu and pokiri".


=== box office ===

=== awards and nominations ===


== legacy ==
dookudu became one of the biggest hits in the history of telugu cinema and was the biggest hit in babu's career by the end of its lifetime run. the film ended the five-year career slump of babu and marked his image makeover. the times of india called it one of the top ten must watch telugu films of 2011. the los angeles times wrote a special article about babu and the film's massive collections in united states and called the film "the biggest hit you've never heard of". after the film's gross crossed 1 billion, income tax department officials conducted a raid on the jubilee hills residence of babu as he was rumoured to get a remuneration of more than 120 million for his next projects.the film's success made samantha one of the most sought heroines in telugu cinema. melton received more offers for performing item numbers post the film's release. dasari narayana rao said the film arrived at the right time and had provided a good amount of relief to the telugu film industry, which was under a huge loss at that point of time. samantha auctioned the costumes used by babu in the film for raising funds for the charity organisation "pratyusha". vaitla's next film with babu namely aagadu (2014), which too was produced by 14 reels entertainment and had the same technical crew of this film, was a failure at the box office. the hindu cited similarities with dookudu as one of the reasons of the film's failure.
