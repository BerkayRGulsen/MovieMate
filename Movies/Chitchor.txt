pitamber chaudhri, headmaster of a school in madhupur, india, has a daughter named geeta (zarina wahab). geeta is a typical village belle  naive, childish, and always in the company of a little boy who is her neighbour.
pitamber's older daughter, meera, who lives in mumbai, informs pitamber of the arrival of a young engineer who could be a possible match for geeta. pitamber is asked to welcome him and treat him well. without further question, pitamber and family do just that when the visitor arrives by train.
vinod (amol palekar), the newcomer, takes an instant liking to the family and to geeta in particular, even teaching her to sing. the family begins to talk about the possibility of vinod and geeta marrying. life is good until another letter from meera arrives. pitamber is shocked to read that the engineer whom meera was sending to meet the family has not yet arrived but will be coming soon. vinod is an overseer who happened to come early, as his boss sunil was delayed and could not make it as planned.
the family is disappointed. they ask geeta to stop seeing vinod and turn her attention to sunil (vijayendra ghatge), the engineer, but geeta cannot forget vinod. sunil is fond of geeta and agrees to the engagement, which is quickly arranged. when vinod hears of the engagement, he prepares to leave the village before the ceremony. upon hearing this, geeta insists that she will marry vinod, against the wishes of her family. she rushes to the train station but not before the train leaves. disheartened, she turns back and is received and driven back to her house by sunil. to her surprise, vinod is at the house. all misconceptions have been cleared up: geeta and vinod are to be engaged.
