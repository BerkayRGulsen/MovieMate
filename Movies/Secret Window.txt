== plot ==
after catching his wife amy having an affair with their friend ted, mystery writer mort rainey retreats to his cabin at tashmore lake in upstate new york, while amy stays in their marital home. six months later, mort, depressed and suffering from writer's block, has delayed finalizing the divorce. one day, a drawling mississippian named john shooter arrives at the cabin and accuses mort of plagiarizing his short story, "sowing season". upon reading shooter's manuscript, mort discovers it is virtually identical to his own story, "secret window", except for the ending.
the following day, mort, who once plagiarized another author's story, tells shooter that his story was published in a mystery magazine two years before shooter's, invalidating his plagiarism claim. shooter demands proof and warns mort against contacting the police. that night, mort's dog, chico, is found dead outside the cabin, along with a note from shooter giving mort three days to provide proof. mort reports the incident to sheriff newsome.
mort drives to his and amy's house intending to retrieve a copy of the magazine but leaves because ted and amy are there. mort hires private investigator ken karsch, who stakes out the cabin and speaks to tom greenleaf, a local resident who may have seen shooter and mort talking together. at the cabin, shooter demands that mort revise his story's ending to shooter's version, where the protagonist kills his wife.
when an arson fire destroys amy and mort's house, and presumably the magazine, mort reveals to the police that he has an enemy. karsch tells mort that he suspects shooter has threatened greenleaf after greenleaf claimed he never saw mort and shooter talking together. mort and karsch agree to confront shooter but first will meet up with greenleaf at the local diner the next morning.
arriving late, mort discovers that neither karsch nor greenleaf showed at the diner. mort encounters ted at a gas station where ted demands mort sign the divorce papers. believing shooter is in ted's employ, mort refuses, taunts ted, and leaves. shooter summons mort to a meeting place; when he arrives, mort finds karsch and greenleaf dead inside greenleaf's truck. shooter arrives and says the two men had "interfered" in his business. shooter warns that he has implicated mort in the two men's murders. mort agrees to meet shooter at his cabin to show him the magazine containing his story, which is supposed to arrive by mail that day, having been overnighted by his literary agent. mort then pushes greenleaf's truck off the steep cliff into a water-filled quarry where it sinks.  while pushing the truck, mort's watch gets caught in the turn signal lever and is able to free his hand at the last second leaving his watch still inside the truck.
mort retrieves the packet containing the magazine from the post office and finds that it has already been opened, with the pages containing his story ripped out. at the cabin, mort sees shooter's hat and puts it on. he begins speaking to himself, trying to make sense of the events. mort realizes that shooter is a figment of his imagination, a created character brought to life through mort's undetected dissociative identity disorder, adopted to carry out malevolent tasks that mort cannot, like killing chico, greenleaf, and karsch, as well as arson.
amy arrives at the cabin, finding it ransacked and sees the word "shooter" carved repeatedly on the walls and furniture. mort appears, speaking and acting as shooter and wearing his hat, which a flashback reveals mort previously bought at a flea market. amy realizes the name "shooter" represents mort's desire to "shoot her". he chases amy and stabs her in the ankle. ted, looking for amy, arrives and is ambushed by mort, who smashes his face with a shovel. amy watches helplessly as mort bludgeons ted with the shovel. presumably, he does the same to her, while reciting the ending of "sowing season".
months later, mort recovers from writer's block and his overall mood improves. he is feared and shunned in town because of the rumors about the missing people associated with him. sheriff newsome arrives and tells mort that he is the prime suspect in the supposed murders. he warns him that the bodies will eventually be found and he will be caught, and says he is no longer welcome in town. mort passively dismisses the threat, and tells newsome that the ending to his new story is "perfect". it is implied that amy and ted's bodies are buried under the corn growing in mort's garden, allowing mort to slowly destroy any evidence of their murders.

== reception ==
on rotten tomatoes, secret window has an approval rating of 46% based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 5.49/10. the site's critics' consensus reads: "depp is quirkily entertaining, but the movie runs out of steam by the end." on metacritic, the film has an aggregated score of 46 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".roger ebert awarded secret window three stars out of a possible four, stating that it "could add up to a straight-faced thriller about things that go boo in the night, but johnny depp and director david koepp ... have too much style to let that happen." he continues by noting that the "story is more entertaining as it rolls along than it is when it gets to the finish line. but at least king uses his imagination right up to the end, and spares us the obligatory violent showdown that a lesser storyteller would have settled for." ian nathan from empire only awarded the film 2 stars out of a possible 5, stating that "the presence of the sublime depp will be enough to get secret window noticed, but even his latest set of rattling eccentricities is not enough to energise this deadbeat parlour trick."the film was a modest box office success, succeeding at recouping its budget of $40 million with a worldwide gross of $92 million.
an alternate ending was included on the home media release, explicitly showing both ted and amy's dead bodies underneath the corn patch in mort's garden. in the final version of the film, it is implied, but the bodies are not shown.
