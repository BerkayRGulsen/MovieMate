== critical reception ==
roger ebert of the chicago sun-times gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and praised certain aspects of the film:

[t]here were long stretches of heart beat during which i found myself wishing instead for a film version of on the road... the movie's a triumph of art direction, all right; the locations, clothes, lighting, moods, music and whole tone of the performances are designed to lower a kind of nostalgic dropcloth over the story... this movie treats its events as so long ago, so finished and done with and bathed in a yellowing afterglow, that we don't sense the very passion and rebelliousness it's supposed to be about. what an irony for the first serious film about the beats.
