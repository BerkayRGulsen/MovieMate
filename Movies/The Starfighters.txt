== production ==
the catchline: "the blazing adventure of the men and planes who rocket to the very edge of space" and the poster showing a character with a full-face visor helmet similar to an astronaut belies the film's very evident "infomercial" look. the majority of the starfighters deals with the training of f-104 pilots during the period when the aircraft was being introduced in the united states air force, and consists predominately of stock footage. the footage was of the f-104s of the 831st air division (479th tactical fighter wing), stationed at george afb from october 1958.the aircraft featured in the starfighters included f-104a and c variants, the boeing kc-135 stratotanker, the lockheed t-33 and the kaman h-43b huskie.


== reception ==
the starfighters was not given wide release and was soon relegated to drive-in theaters and second run showings. although it was not critically reviewed, audience reaction since has continually placed it in the category of one of the "worst films" ever.

the starfighters was featured in episode #612 of mystery science theater 3000. the cast and crew (and later fans) of mystery science theater 3000 were the film's most prominent critics. tom servo summed it up thus: "so basically, according to themselves, the air force is a bunch of leather-faced, not-so-bright, heavy drinking, dull-witted speed freaks who poop in their pants and can't make it with women, right?" the mystery science theater 3000 amazing colossal episode guide complained "nothing happens in it." it provided several running gags that were repeated throughout the series: humming the jazzy music whenever an aircraft is seen flying, mentions of the "poopie suit" (an air force survival suit designed to help contain body heat in the event of a bailout over water), and the use of the word "refueling" as a synonym for any long, dull scene.
