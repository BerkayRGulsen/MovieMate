== critical reception ==
allmovie called it a "silly australian slasher film". jim schembri wrote in cinema papers that:

it is an unspeakably funny film, but in the saddest possible way. it is a film promoted as a horror film, and it is for anyone with any faith left in australian mainstream film... for a film as awful, as cliche ridden, as derivative as unimaginative and as poorly made as bloodmoon to be made in australia in 1990 is a cause of national mourning.
