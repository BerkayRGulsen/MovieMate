== plot ==
the plot portrays the swedish government as being responsible for using the ship to covertly transport russian high-tech components to the united states. the story is uncovered by a young female journalist, not unlike rabe herself. according to rabe, divers hired by the swedish government (signing contracts swearing lifetime secrecy) spent hours breaking into cabins frantically searching for a black attach case carried by a russian space technology dealer, aleksandr voronin (who died 2002). she highlighted us interest in various soviet technology, including nuclear-powered satellites. she also suggested that panic about the stability of some form of nuclear device is the most likely reason behind the initial swedish government suggestion of burying the wreck in concrete, a highly unusual proposal for a wreck, reminiscent of chernobyl's sarcophagus.
