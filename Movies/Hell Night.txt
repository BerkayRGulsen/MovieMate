== production ==


=== conception ===
chuck russell, who would later direct a nightmare on elm street 3: dream warriors (1987), served as executive producer on the film. during the production, producer bruce cohn curtis urged the filmmakers to implement an extended chase sequence for linda blair's character after seeing jamie lee curtis's chase sequence in terror train (1980); this was the basis of the chase sequence that takes place in the tunnels under the mansion.


=== filming ===

filming hell night took 40 days in the fall and winter of 1980, between november 1980 and january 1981. the original shooting budget was a reported $1 million, but the shoot's duration through the holidays extended the budget an additional $400,000. the film's shooting schedule reportedly consisted of six-day weeks and was described as grueling. star linda blair recalled the daily shoots lasting from 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., as well as spending thanksgiving with the cast and crew on a double-decker bus rented by the producers. according to desimone, peter barton hurt himself on set, and as a result most of his limping in the movie was due to actual physical pain from the injury, rather than being acted.
the majority of the movie was shot in three locations: the exterior of garth manor was shot at the kimberly crest mansion in redlands, california. the hedge maze was brought in as there was no actual garden maze on the mansion property. the inside of garth manor was filmed in a residential home in pasadena, california. the frat party was filmed in an apartment lobby in los angeles, california. the seemingly many tunnels in the movie were actually only two corridors through which the director had the actors repeatedly running from different angles.
director de simone stated he wanted a "classic gothic look" for the film: "i don't like these horror films where people are walking around haunted houses wearing jeans and t-shirts. so we threw our heads together and i said i wanted linda in a gothic kind of wardrobe. and we came up with the idea to make the hell night party a costume party. and that way we were able to have everyone in those kinds of costumes that suited their personality."the two actors who portrayed the garth killers are not listed anywhere in the credits, although their real names are believed to be valentino richardson and chad butler. however, on the film's dvd commentary, it was noted that they are both german nationals who spoke little or no english, and that one of them (the middle-aged bearded man) died shortly after the release of the film.
