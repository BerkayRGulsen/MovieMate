== reception ==
roger greenspun wrote in the new york times:"jenny" is a very oldfashioned film, gently accumulating the paraphernalia of a certain opportune modernism. all the movie memories are intellectual properties of a sort that you may discard if you wish to 'sigh' over the sadhappy story of a girl and her guy and her baby.
but it isn't so easy to make oldfashioned movies now, and the values and lifestyles the film plays with, keep playing with it in returnso that jenny often stumbles into (and alas, out of) a better kind of movie than it has any right to be.
