=== critical reception ===
allmovie noted "a softly beautiful, hauntingly poetic little film, a fragile piece of filmmaking that in other hands could come off as either unbearably precious or pretentious. fortunately, time is shepherded by desmond davis, who handles the material with just the right degree of sensitivity;" however, time out called it "a horribly pretentious and sentimental film which still manages to retain a degree of emotional power, with moments of real intensity and conviction...the film is certainly much better than davis' earlier irish story the girl with green eyes (also adapted from edna o'brien), but it's dogged by the awful tricks of overemphasis which he seems to have learned from his patron tony richardson"; while tv guide thought it, "slow in pace, with beautiful photography and fine acting, this is a well-told tale of disenchantment and resignation."
