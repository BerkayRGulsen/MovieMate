== production ==
chris lofven and lyne helms got the idea to make an australian version of the wizard of oz while working in london in the early 1970s. lofven was also inspired by david bowie and wanted graham matters to feature.they moved back to australia in september 1974, and house sat at the house of david williamson for six months writing the script (lofven's sister kristen was married to williamson). the first draft was rejected for funding but the second got some development from the australian film development corporation in march 1975, shortly before it became the australian film commission.
the budget was $150,000 with $260,000 in contra deals. the australian film commission invested $90,000 plus a loan of $25,000 and greater union put in $25,000 with the rest from private investment. the money took six months to raise.joy dunstan was a singer and theatre actress who was cast after lofven saw her singing at the flying trapeze cafe. it was her first movie.the film was shot in early 1976 over a five-week period near melbourne.


== release ==
the film was a commercial disappointment on release in australia despite receiving some excellent reviews. it may have been hurt by the fact the soundtrack was not ready before the film came out in july. however the movie was released in the us and was one of the highest-grossing australian films there, grossing over $1 million before its release in the largest markets in new york and los angeles, and has become a cult movie.


== soundtrack ==
wilson, gary young and wayne burt were all former members of daddy cool. their biggest hit single "eagle rock" had a promo video directed by lfvn in 1971. by late 1975, daddy cool had disbanded and wilson was waiting out his contract with wizard records by producing a company caine album for his own label oz records. wilson signed jo jo zep & the falcons with members young and burt to his label. contractually free, wilson recorded his first solo single "livin' in the land of oz" and produced jo jo zep & the falcons' second single "beating around the bush" both released mid-1976 from this soundtrack.
