dancer in the dark is the third film in von trier's "golden heart trilogy", following breaking the waves (1996) and the idiots (1998). it was an international co-production among companies based in thirteen european and north american countries and regions. it was shot with a handheld camera, and inspired by a dogme 95 look.

== plot ==
in washington state in 1964, selma jekov, a czech immigrant, has moved to the united states with her 12 year-old son, gene jeek. they live a life of poverty as selma works at a factory with her good friend kathy, whom she nicknames cvalda. she rents a trailer home on the property of town policeman bill houston and his wife, linda. she is also pursued by the shy but persistent jeff, who also works at the factory.
selma has a degenerative eye condition and is losing her vision. she has been saving up to pay for an operation which will prevent her young son from losing his vision. she also takes part in rehearsals for a production of the sound of music and accompanies kathy to the local cinema, where together they watch hollywood musicals, as kathy describes them to her.
in her day-to-day life, selma slips into daydreams, imagining that she's in a musical. jeff and kathy begin to realize that selma's vision is worse than they thought, and she's been cheating at her vision tests by memorizing the charts in order to keep her job at the factory. bill reveals to selma that his materialistic wife spends more than his salary, and the bank is going to take his house. he tells her he planned to shoot himself, but couldn't bring himself to do it. to comfort bill, selma reveals that she's going blind, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. bill pretends to leave selma's trailer but stays, knowing she can't see him, and watches her hide her money in a tin.
the next day, after accidentally breaking a machine at the factory, selma is fired from her job. when she comes home to put her money in the tin, she discovers it's empty. selma realizes that bill stole it and goes to his house to confront him. linda accuses selma of trying to seduce her husband, explaining that bill told her selma wanted him for his money. not wanting to expose bill's secret that she promised not to tell, selma ignores linda and goes upstairs to confront bill about the theft. he pulls a gun on her, and they fight over the money.
selma accidentally shoots bill, who yells for linda and tells her that selma tried to rob him. linda runs off to tell the police at bill's command. bill then begs selma to kill him, telling her that this will be the only way she will ever reclaim the money that he stole from her. selma shoots him several times, but due to her blindness manages to only maim bill further. when the gun runs out of bullets, selma beats him to death with the safe deposit box. selma slips into a trance and imagines that bill's corpse stands up and slow dances with her. selma takes her money back and uses it to pay for gene's operation.
jeff, not knowing about the murder, takes selma to rehearsal, where her director calls the police on her. in court, she is accused of being a communist sympathizer and of pretending to be blind to exploit the american healthcare system. although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to. when her claim that the reason she did not have any money was because she had been sending it to her father in czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted of murder and given the death penalty. kathy and jeff eventually put the pieces of the puzzle together and get back selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. selma refuses the lawyer, opting to face the death penalty rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death. as selma begins crying, kathy runs in to tell her that the operation was successful and that gene will see. relieved, selma sings the final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment. the trap door opens and she is killed mid song.


== cast ==


== style ==
much of the film has a similar look to von trier's earlier dogme 95-influenced films: it is filmed on low-end, hand-held digital cameras to create a documentary-style appearance. it is not a true dogme 95 film, however, because the dogme rules stipulate that violence, non-diegetic music, and period pieces are not permitted. trier differentiates the musical sequences from the rest of the film by using static cameras and by brightening the colours.


== production ==

the film's title suggests the fred astaire/cyd charisse duet "dancing in the dark" from the 1953 film the band wagon, which ties in with the film's musical theatre theme.
actress bjrk, who is known primarily as a contemporary musician, had rarely acted before, and described the process of making this film as so emotionally taxing that she would not act in any film ever again (although she appeared in matthew barney's film installation drawing restraint 9 in 2005, and is set to appear in robert eggers' the northman). deneuve and others have described her performance as feeling rather than acting. bjrk has said that it is a misunderstanding that she was put off acting by this film; rather, she never wanted to act but made an exception for lars von trier.the musical sequences were filmed simultaneously with over 100 digital cameras so that multiple angles of the performance could be captured and cut together later, thus shortening the filming schedule.
bjrk lies down on a stack of birch logs during the "scatterheart" sequence. in icelandic and swedish, "bjrk" means "birch".
a danish my class locomotive (owned by swedish train operator tgab) was painted in the american great northern scheme for the movie, and not repainted afterward. a t43 class locomotive was repainted too, though never used in the film.

== controversy ==
in october 2017, bjrk posted on her facebook page that she had been sexually harassed by a "danish film director she worked with". she commented:

it was extremely clear to me when i walked into the actresses profession that my humiliation and role as a lesser sexually harassed being was the norm and set in stone with the director and a staff of dozens who enabled it and encouraged it. i became aware of that it is a universal thing that a director can touch and harass his actresses at will and the institution of film allows it. when i turned the director down repeatedly he sulked and punished me and created for his team an impressive net of illusion where i was framed as the difficult one. ...
and in my opinion he had a more fair and meaningful relationship with his actresses after my confrontation so there is hope. let's hope this statement supports the actresses and actors all over. let's stop this. there is a wave of change in the world."
the los angeles times found evidence identifying him as lars von trier. von trier has rejected bjrk's allegation that he sexually harassed her during the making of the film dancer in the dark, and said "that was not the case. but that we were definitely not friends, thats a fact," to danish daily jyllands-posten in its online edition. peter aalbk jensen, the producer of dancer in the dark, told jyllands-posten that "as far as i remember we [lars von trier and i] were the victims. that woman was stronger than both lars von trier and me and our company put together. she dictated everything and was about to close a movie of 100m kroner [$16m]."
after von trier's statement, bjrk explained the details about this incident, saying:
in the spirit of #metoo i would like to lend women around the world a hand with a more detailed description of my experience with a danish director . it feels extremely difficult to come out with something of this nature into the public , especially when immediately ridiculed by offenders . i fully sympathise with everyone who hesitates , even for years . but i feel it is the right time especially now when it could make a change . here comes a list of the encounters that i think count as sexual harassment :
1 after each take the director ran up to me and wrapped his arms around me for a long time in front of all crew or alone and stroked me sometimes for minutes against my wishes
2 when after 2 months of this i said he had to stop the touching , he exploded and broke a chair in front of everyone on set . like someone who has always been allowed to fondle his actresses . then we all got sent home .
3 during the whole filming process there were constant awkward paralysing unwanted whispered sexual offers from him with graphic descriptions , sometimes with his wife standing next to us .
4 while filming in sweden , he threatened to climb from his rooms balcony over to mine in the middle of the night with a clear sexual intention , while his wife was in the room next door . i escaped to my friends room . this was what finally woke me up to the severity of all this and made me stand my ground
5 fabricated stories in the press about me being difficult by his producer . this matches beautifully the weinstein methods and bullying . i have never eaten a shirt . not sure that is even possible .
6 i didnt comply or agree on being sexually harassed . that was then portrayed as me being difficult . if being difficult is standing up to being treated like that , ill own it .
hope
lets break this curse
warmth

bjrk
bjrk's manager, derek birkett, has also accused von trier's actions in the past, stating:
i have worked with bjrk for over 30 years and have never made a single statement or interview regarding our work together. this time is different.
i have read the lies written by lars and his producer peter about bjrk  and feel compelled to speak out and put the record straight. over the last 30 years the dancer in the dark project is the one and only time she has fallen out with a collaborator.

this was a result of the directors ongoing, disrespectful verbal and physical abuse which continued after both bjrk and myself demanded that he stop behaving this way. bjrk completed the film out of respect for the cast and everyone involved. i feel compelled to publicly speak out in fierce support of bjrk in regards to her terrible experiences working with lars von trier, and i back what she has said 110%.
