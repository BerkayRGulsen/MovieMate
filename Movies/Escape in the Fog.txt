== reception ==
film critic jeremy arnold gave the film a mixed review, writing "although wright and foch have the most screen time, top billing goes to otto kruger, the immensely enjoyable character actor who specialized in charming, urbane villains. he's fine as always here but doesn't get much to do. william wright was an unremarkable actor who appeared almost entirely in b movies in a 45-film career that spanned the 1940s."
