the film had a production budget of 1.55 crore ($2 million). it began filming in 1979, and was one of the most expensive indian films at the time. feroz khan's expenses included 23 lakh for a new camera, 5.3 lakh for several scenes (including a song sequence) on a large set (representing a pathan's den), and 16,590 for an authentic silver sword. cine blitz suggested in 1979 that the production costs of qurbani may exceed abdullah, another similarly expensive production at the time.to draw shock from the audience, a scene was included with the calculated decimation of a mercedes benz in an underground parking lot. this was at a time when not many in india had seen a mercedes, let alone sat in one.
uk stunts were designed and arranged by james dowdall, photographed by eric van herren and produced by nick farnes who, with james dowdall, wrote the uk scenario.
feroz khan initially asked amitabh bachchan to play the role of amar. amitabh replied he would be available in 6 months, according to feroz, but feroz could not wait that long. so the role of amar went to vinod khanna.

== music ==

biddu was the music director for the song "aap jaisa koi", which introduced him and pakistani singer nazia hassan to indian films. the first initial song biddu recorded for qurbani was a hindi version of a boney m. song. when nazia hassan and zoheb hassan heard it, they refused saying they didn't want to sing a copy. they insisted they wanted an original song. a reluctant biddu asked them what they had in mind. that's when "aap jaisa koi" was born.
the rest of the songs and the background score were set by kalyanjianandji. the song "laila o laila" was also very popular. the album was written by faruk kaiser and indeevar.
the movie is known for its music and songs, including the title qawwali "qurbani qurbani", written by the urdu poet, faruk kaiser and rendered by anwar, kishore kumar and aziz nazan. it has a song performed by mohammed rafi, kya dekhte ho, which was written by indeevar. qurbani qurbani received a special award for 'the most amazing evergreen song' by bollywood music producer, kalyanjianandji.
feroz khan met biddu and nazia hassan at a party hosted by a close friend in england. nazias parents insisted feroz listen to nazia sing. feroz did and was highly impressed. but feroz had his eye on international star biddu to score a song for qurbani. biddu was reluctant to score music for an indian film. it was with sincere persistence and feroz telling biddu to do it for his mom who lived in india. feroz also played the bangalore card with biddu since both feroz and biddu both hailed from bangalore.
many music directors (including the film's original music directors kalyanjianandji) opposed feroz khan hiring biddu to score a solo song in the film. many tried to stop this because they viewed biddu as an outsider. after several discussions, feroz khan stuck to his choice.
