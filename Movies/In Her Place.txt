== plot ==
inspired by korean culture's strong stigma against adoption, the film stars gil hae-yeon and ahn ji-hye as a mother and daughter living on a farm in south korea. when the teenage daughter becomes pregnant, a woman (yoon da-gyeong) arrives from seoul to propose a secret adoption, conditional on her staying with them for the duration of the pregnancy so that she can hide the adoption when she returns to seoul after the baby's birth.

== production ==
the film was shot entirely in korea at shin's family farm. regarding his inspirations for the film, shin said: i had this idea of, "what if i bring together three women? and what if they were of different generations? and what if i told the film from three different perspectives?" and, instead of it being vignettes i made it one linear film and switched the point of view, all contained in one space.
