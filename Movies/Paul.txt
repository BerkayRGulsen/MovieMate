== plot ==
graeme willy and clive gollings are british comic book enthusiasts and best friends who travel to the united states to attend the annual san diego comic-con. later, taking a road trip through the southwestern u.s. to visit ufo sites on a remote desert highway at night, they brush with rednecks at a diner, they watch a car driving erratically and then crashing. they then stop, offering assistance to the driver, an alien named paul (paranoid alien ultra life-force), who graeme agrees to give a ride to, despite clive fainting and wetting his pants upon seeing him. 
later, special agent zoil of the fbi arrives at the car-crash site, informing his unseen female superior, "the big guy", that he is closing in on paul. she sends rookies haggard and o'reilly to assist. clive remains paranoid over paul's intentions, considering his appearance evidence of a conspiracy, until paul tells them the government fed his image to the public to keep them from panicking if anyone encounters his race.  they later camp at an rv park run by christian fundamentalists, one-eyed ruth buggs and her father moses. the next day, when ruth sees paul, she faints, so they take her with them. during an argument, paul convinces ruth to question her beliefs and uses his healing power to cure her blind eye. 
they stop at a bar and ruth calls her father, but zoil intercepts the call. she is then accosted by the rednecks and a bar fight ensues. they escape when paul terrifies the rednecks into fainting. later, at another rv park, ruth is questioned by agent zoil, but plays dumb and escapes. meanwhile, haggard and o'reilly have figured out about paul. when they confront zoil, he orders them to return to base, but they go behind his back and try to catch the alien on their own.
the group soon arrives at tara's, who rescued paul when he crashed on earth 60 years ago, accidentally killing her dog (hence paul's name) in the crash (opening scene). as no-one believed her story, she has spent her life as a pariah. although angry at first, she forgives paul and makes coffee for her visitors. just then, haggard, o'reilly and zoil surround the house. they flee but o'reilly shoots at them, igniting gas from tara's stove and destroying her house with him inside. haggard pursues and catches up to the rv but loses control and drives off a cliff. zoil reassures the big guy that he will have paul within the hour but tired of waiting, she orders a "military response".
paul, graeme, clive, ruth and tara arrive at devils tower national monument, where they set off fireworks to signal paul's mothership. a helicopter suddenly arrives with agents and the big guy. zoil then appears and initiates a stand-off, unexpectedly shooting the agents, before being wounded. he is revealed to be paul's friend, attempting to aid his escape under the guise of capturing him. during the fight, tara knocks out the big guy. moses arrives unexpectedly and fires at paul, but hits graeme instead. paul once again uses his healing powers, reviving graeme in spite of the danger to himself, causing moses to believe paul to be a messiah. 
graeme and ruth admit their feelings for each other and kiss, but then the big guy regains consciousness and holds the group at gunpoint. just as she is about to kill them, she is crushed by the landing mother ship. paul says goodbye to his friends and offers tara a chance to go with him, promising to give her a new life after ruining her childhood and accidentally killing her dog. the aliens go home as the remaining humans wave. two years later, graeme, clive and ruth are at another comic-con, where graeme and clive are promoting their new bestselling novel titled paul.

== production ==

the idea for paul came from pegg and frost in 2003, while they were filming shaun of the dead. to help with the script, pegg and frost went on their own road trip across america and used ideas from it to add to the script. according to mottola, the film was given the green light shortly before the late 2000s recession; if it had been delayed, "they probably wouldnt have made the movie." the budget for the film was around us$40 million. principal photography, including 50 days in the new mexico desert, wrapped on 9 september 2009, with additional scenes filmed in july 2010 at the albuquerque convention center, which was designed to look like the 2010 san diego comic-con. during filming, joe lo truglio was a stand-in for the character paul, the only character who was created by cgi, although seth rogen, the voice of paul did some motion capture in preproduction during postproduction. the cover art for the fictional comic book encounter briefs was drawn by alternative comics artist daniel clowes.

== reception ==


=== critical response ===
paul received generally positive reviews from critics. on rotten tomatoes, the film holds a 70% approval rating based on 203 reviews with an average rating of 6.31/10. the site's critical consensus reads, "it doesn't measure up to pegg and frost's best work, but paul is an amiably entertaining  albeit uneven  road trip comedy with an intergalactic twist". on metacritic, the film has a score of 57/100 (indicating "mixed or average reviews") based on 37 critics.empire rated the film "excellent" (four stars out of five), stating, "broader and more accessible than either shaun of the dead or hot fuzz, paul is pure pegg and frost  clever, cheeky, and very, very funny. you'll never look at e.t. in the same way again." sfx also gives the film four stars out of five, saying, "the film veers dangerously close to alienating (no pun intended) all but its geek core audience, [though] the more obvious concessions to a mainstream crowd [are] never enough to derail the film's laugh-a-minute ride"; sfx also calls it a "triumph of visual effects, convincing characterisation and bad taste humour." peter bradshaw gave the film two stars out of five and called it a "goofy, amiable piece of silliness" exhibiting "self-indulgence" and possessing a "distinct shortage of real gags". on the same scale nigel andrews gave the film only one star, calling it a "faltering extraterrestrial knockabout". the independent grades the film two stars out of five, saying, "pegg is likeable as usual, frost more doltish than usual, and kristen wiig an appealing convert from bible thumper to ladette", and notes that "from time to time, clever ideas rear their heads  like the idea that 'paul' has been the brains behind all science-fiction and ufo initiatives for the last 30 years, including close encounters and the x-files  but they soon return to the film's default setting of laddish japes and a conviction that the word 'cocksucker' will always get a laugh."ign provided paul with three reviews. the first gave the film three stars, stating, "simon pegg and nick frost send up everything from star wars to e.t. in this sci-fi comedy ... as with pegg and frost's previous films together, it's derivative stuff, the plot similar to countless sci-fi flicks of the past; paying homage to the good and gently ribbing the bad." less excited was their review for the british blu-ray version, which said, "but unlike previous pegg and frost collaborations  shaun of the dead and hot fuzz  paul does not generously reward repeat viewing. that's not to say it's a bad film at all; it has a strong central premise, which carries much of the film, loveable central characters, the odd neat idea (it turns out that paul inspired all major works of sf post-1950, from close encounters to the x-files, and has a direct line to steven spielberg), and a couple of genuine laughs, but it never feels more than a rough sketch of a bigger, much funnier movie." in a second review for the american blu-ray version, ign compared the movie with galaxy quest and wrote that it is "richly layered with clever homage, a refreshingly original alien hero, delightfully entertaining characters and great performances from our leads and their supporting players."upon its release in the united states, roger ebert gave paul a mixed review of two and a half stars out of four, saying it is a "movie that teeters on the edge of being really pretty good and loses its way. i'm not sure quite what goes wrong, but you can see that it might have gone right."  according to manohla dargis, "as genial, foolish and demographically engineered as it sounds (hailing all fan boys and girls), paul is at once a buddy flick and a classic american road movie of self (and other) discovery, interspersed with buckets of expletives and some startling (especially for a big-studio release) pokes at christian fundamentalism ... the movie has its attractions, notably mr. pegg and mr. frost (and of course mr. bateman), whose ductile, (noncomputer) animated and open faces were made for comedy ... paul proves the weak link. one problem is that mr. rogen, however comically inclined, has become overexposed, and theres just something too familiar and predictable about this voice coming out of that body. yet while paul seems great conceptually, hes not particularly interesting or surprising, despite a funny recap of what hes been doing on his time on earth. with his vibe and vocabulary, shorts and weed, juvenilia and sentimentality, paul turns out to be not much different from a lot of guys who have wreaked comedy havoc on american screens lately, even if this one only wants to beam up, not knock up."


=== box office ===
the film has grossed $97,984,015 worldwide. in north america, paul opened in march 2011 with $13,043,310. the film closed after 63 days, grossing $37,412,945 against a budget of $40 million.
