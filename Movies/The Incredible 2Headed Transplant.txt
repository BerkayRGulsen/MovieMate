== reception ==
variety called the film "rank exploitation fodder" directed "lifelessly," though it called the makeup and design of the two-headed creature "good." gene siskel of the chicago tribune gave the film 1 star out 4, writing that if the film "had focused more on the conflict of the two heads with, say, some extended conversations in close-up, it could have been one of the great bad movies. instead, we get repetitive shots of the killer drooling while the giant whines 'no, no.'" kevin thomas of the los angeles times called the film "lots of fun because this aip release has been so thoroughly worked out, with good, legitimate performances, logical plot development and taut directing and editing." david mcgillivray of the monthly film bulletin wrote, "uproarious nonsense, looking very much like a piece of low budget fifties horror and performed with very little finesse, but quite watchable none the less."
