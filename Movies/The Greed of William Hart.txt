== production ==
the film was originally made as a fairly direct historical adaptation of the burke and hare murders. the british board of film censors, however, insisted that all references to the real-life murderers be removed. the film was then re-titled and re-dubbed with different character names, substituting "hart" and "moore" for hare and burke, respectively, and "dr. cox" for dr. knox. all other names, including victims mary patterson, mrs. docherty, and "daft jamie" wilson, remain unchanged.writer john gilling would go on to script another version of the same story in 1960, titled the flesh and the fiends. this version used the correct names for the killers.
the film was made at bushey studios.


== distribution ==
the film was distributed in the united states by j.h. hoffberg productions in 1953, slightly edited, as horror maniacs.
