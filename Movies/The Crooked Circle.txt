before a boxer dies in an accident, he mentions that he should "get lost like joe kelly" to sportswriter ken cooper. now curious what became of kelly, a former contender, cooper locates him in a remote town where joe runs a fishing lodge with his brother, tommy.
carol smith, girlfriend of tommy, immediately urges cooper to help tommy get into boxing. joe is adamantly opposed to this, causing friction between the brothers. joe finally relents, warning tommy to change his name and avoid a criminal element.
al taylor, an honest trainer, handles the promising tommy at first, until corrupt manager larry ellis, arena owner max maxwell and gambler sam lattimer sink their hooks into the kid. tommy begins winning fights and making enough money to buy carol an expensive engagement ring. he becomes disillusioned only after being told that all his fights were fixed, and that he is expected to deliberately lose the next.
