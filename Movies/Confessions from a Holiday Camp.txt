== plot ==
timmy lea and his brother-in-law sidney noggett are working as entertainment officers at funfrall, a typical british holiday camp. the staff are lazy and inefficient, preferring to laze by the pool rather than organise activities for the holiday campers. a new owner, mr. whitemonk, an  ex-prison officer, takes over the camp and is determined to install discipline into the staff. he is on the verge of dismissing timmy and sidney; however, sidney's suggestion of organising a beauty contest changes his mind.
producer michael klinger was not happy with the script, noting a number of problems that he felt detracted from the quality that set the series apart from its imitators.[1]

although holiday camp would turn out to be the last film in the series, a fifth and a sixth film, confessions of a plumber's mate and confessions of a private soldier, had been planned in 1977. filming was set to begin on plumber's mate at the end of february 1978. robin askwith even expressed a desire to direct private soldier, but neither film materialised. in november 1977 the studio cancelled plans for future films. columbia pictures president david begelman, who had been very supportive of the british film industry and who had green-lit the first confessions film, had been implicated in a cheque-forging scandal and either quit or was fired. his successor had no interest in financing low-budget, profitable british films.producer michael klinger rejected a script based on confessions from a haunted house[2]. plans to shoot a made-for-video confessions film in the 1980s also came to nothing, as did a proposed 1992 film, "confessions of a squaddie", which was proposed with action due to take place in post-gulf war kuwait.
