== production background ==
mae west was 49 at the time of the movie's production, her first film in three years, after an interlude starring on broadway. unlike her previous films, for which west wrote the screenplays and/or story material, west played no part in creating the story or dialogue of the heat's on.  perhaps as a result, the movie was not a box office success.  west did not return to the screen until 27 years later in myra breckenridge (1970), and chose to pursue a successful career in theater instead.
