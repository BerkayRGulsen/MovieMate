== plot ==
mays gilliam is the alderman for the 9th ward in washington, d.c.. after learning he is likely to lose his job and getting dumped by his girlfriend, kim, gilliam is unexpectedly chosen as the democratic party candidate for the 2004 presidential election after his party's original presidential and vice-presidential nominees die in a plane crash and he is lauded as a hero for saving a woman from an explosion. assuming the election was already lost to incumbent republican vice-president brian lewis, the democrats decided to pick a likable but unwinnable minority candidate to improve their chances in the 2008 presidential election.
at first, gilliam feels he will not be able to succeed as president because he would be representing the entire african-american populace, and does not want to do anything to damage his reputation. however, gilliam begins to rise in the polls after his brother mitch persuades him to speak out for what he believes in. he begins to talk about major issues such as welfare, money, and society.
after lewis runs a series of attack ads including one saying gilliam supports cancer, gilliam begins to fight back using what he claimed was "kissing" his opponent (taken from bugs bunnyelmer fudd cartoons). a part of this strategy includes dubbing a videotape of osama bin laden saying he hates america but loves brian lewis. this strategy gains gilliam even more points in the polls.
as election day draws closer, gilliam eventually learns the reason why he was chosen as the party candidate, fires some disloyal campaign operatives (despite them having reconciled with him afterwards), and chooses his brother as his running mate. he later has a debate with his opponent in which he manages to win the crowd over by speaking truth about american life. finally, gilliam ends up winning the presidency, and proposes to lisa by saying he wants to make her his first lady.

== inspiration ==
rock said in hbo first look that he got the idea from the 1984 democratic presidential nominee walter mondale, who chose geraldine ferraroa womanas his running mate. the democrats knew they had little chance of defeating ronald reagan, but selected ferraro in hopes of gaining female support.
in one scene, gilliam quotes "the roof is on fire" by rock master scott & the dynamic three.
according to the dvd audio commentary, the scene where gilliam sings "deep in the heart of texas" is a reference to pee-wee's big adventure, where pee-wee herman does the same thing.
part of the presidential debate is a verbatim repeat of monty python's argument clinic.
