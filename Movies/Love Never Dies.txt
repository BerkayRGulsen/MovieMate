== production ==

vidors spectacular cattle stampede in his previous picture sky pilot (1921) was admired by critics.  hoping to capitalize on that success, vidor designed and built an elaborate model replica of a train and trestle and used it to stage a dramatic derailment. impressed by this special effect demonstration, thomas h. ince agreed to finance the completion of love never dies.
