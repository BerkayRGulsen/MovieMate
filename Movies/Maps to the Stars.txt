using havana's role in stolen waters to gain access to the production lot, agatha visits benjie on set. a schizophrenic, agatha tells him that she has returned from a sanatorium to make amends for setting the fire that burned her and nearly killed him when he was seven. when stafford learns agatha visited benjie, he finds her in her hotel room, gives her $10,000, and tells her to leave l.a. before she ruins everything.
benjie breaks his sobriety, getting high on ghb, and carelessly shoots the dog of his only friend. agatha visits her mother, cristina, and reveals that before she set the fire she had discovered that her parents were brother and sister, making agatha and benjie children of incest. cristina tells her they were separated as children and didn't know they were related. stafford comes home, and when agatha tells him she knows about their familial relations, stafford violently beats her, until cristina intervenes. during the altercation, agatha steals cristina's wedding ring. on set, benjie is haunted by the girl from the hospital and, during an hallucination, he strangles his young co-star. the child survives, though benjie is now to be replaced in the film.
havana requests jerome as a driver and seduces him in the backseat of his parked limo in the driveway of her home as agatha watches from the window. havana enters the house and berates agatha for her poor performance at work and then verbally humiliates her when she finds that the girl has stained her expensive couch with menstrual blood. agatha beats havana to death with one of her awards.

== production ==


=== development ===

plans for the film hit financial difficulties and it was in development for around six years. during promotion of cosmopolis in may 2012, at cannes, david cronenberg said that "it's not a 'go' picture. we have a script that i love that bruce wrote; it's a very difficult film to get made as was cosmopolis actually. whether i can get this movie to happen, i tried it five years ago, i couldn't get it made, so i still might not be able to get it made." he also added that "maps to the stars is very extreme. it's not obviously a very big commercial movie, and even as an independent film it's difficult. maps to the stars is completely different [from cosmopolis], but it's very acerbic and satirical; it's a hard sell."talking about the script, cronenberg revealed that "it's kind of a satire on hollywood. it's very typical of bruce wagner's writing. and it's sort of a condensed essence of bruce. and while it's satirical, it's also very powerful, emotionally, and insightful and funny. you could say it's a hollywood film because the characters are agents, actors and managers, but it is not a satire like the player." producer martin katz described it as an "absurdist comedy about the entertainment business."


=== casting ===
viggo mortensen and rachel weisz were initially cast but left due to scheduling difficulties, and were later replaced by cusack and moore. moore, who bleached her hair blonde for the part of havana, said in an interview about the film that, "it's not only about celebrity culture, but the pursuit of fame at any cost." it is the second collaboration between pattinson and cronenberg after cosmopolis.


=== pre-production ===
production began in july 2013. cronenberg stated that "it would be the first time i've ever shot a foot of film in the united states. it's strange, just because of the way the co-production deals work, that even though i've had movies that are set in the u.s. like cosmopolis or the dead zone, i've never shot in the united states. this would be the first time. and i'm really excited about it." he further added that "well, maps to the stars is an l.a. story and i really felt that is something i could not create on a set in toronto, whereas the structure of cosmopolis allows me to create new york on a soundstage in toronto.

the film generated mostly positive reviews, and performances from the cast were praised. review aggregator rotten tomatoes reports that 61% of 155 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.3/10. the site's summary states: "narratively unwieldy and tonally jumbled, maps to the stars still has enough bite to satisfy david cronenberg fans in need of a coolly acidic fix." on metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the films holds an average score of 67, based on 39 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".dave calhoun of time out stated that "this creepy portrait of beverly hills screw-ups is deeply silly, but it has just enough venomous bite." the daily telegraph's robbie collin gave the film five stars out of five and wrote that it "takes place in a kind of pharmaceutically heightened hyper-reality of its own: it's not so much a twisted dream of making it in show-business, as a writhing, hissing, hollywood waking nightmare." he said that "moore, in particular, is tremendous" and concluded that "cronenberg has made a film that you want to unsee  and then see and unsee again." oliver lyttelton, in his review for the playlist, graded the film b+ by saying that "the film is a sickly enjoyable wallow in the scandalous, fucked-up side of showbusiness, and a real return to form for the filmmaker." peter bradshaw of the guardian gave the film four out of five stars and called the film "a gripping and exquisitely horrible movie about contemporary hollywood  positively vivisectional in its sadism and scorn." mark kermode, also of the guardian, compared the film to "sunset boulevard, with sprinklings of chinatown, beyond the valley of the dolls and mommie dearest thrown in for good measure." he called moore "magnificently horrendous" with wasikowska "provid[ing] ice-cool counterpoint", williams "terrific" and pattinson "nicely underplayed". in his review for slant magazine, budd wilkins compared the film to david lynch's mulholland drive (2001): "maps to the stars is a scabrous, etched-in-acid comedy that digs deeper into the perversions and pathologies undergirding the dream factory than anything since mulholland drive."however, peter debruge of variety criticized the film as "part showbiz sendup, part ghost story, part dysfunctional-family drama, [it] instead comes across as so much jaded mumbo-jumbo." todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter thought that the film "comes off like a prank more than a coherent take on 21st century hollywood, even if there are crumbs of truth and wit scattered throughout it." lee marshall of screen international said that "the film doesn't quite get away with its attempt to reconcile satire with pathos, but it comes perilously close."the film was included in the list of "canada's top ten" feature films of 2014, selected by a panel of filmmakers and industry professionals organized by tiff.
