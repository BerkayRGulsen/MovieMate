== production and release ==
the film is based on the 1939 novel the elephant is white, written by caryl brahms and her russian migr writing partner s. j. simon, but the story was moved from paris in the 1930s to london in the late 1940s. brahms and simon provided additional dialogue to director val guest's screenplay.
the film opened at the new gallery cinema in london on 31 july 1944, less than two months after d-day and almost a year before the war would end in europe. film reviewers at the time were not very impressed - the times reviewer found it to be "a film which opens well [but] ends not with the bang of vigorous cinematic invention but the whimper of overworked dialogue." - but more recently the film has been described by one reviewer as "one of the most delightful comedies ever made".lockwood had just become a star with the man in grey but did not want to be typecast as a villainess.
