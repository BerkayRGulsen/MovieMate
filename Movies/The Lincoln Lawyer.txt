== plot ==
criminal defense attorney mickey haller (matthew mcconaughey) works in la county, california, mostly from the back of his black lincoln town car, chauffeured by earl briggs  (laurence mason). most of his career has been defending low-end criminals, such as a biker club led by eddie vogel (trace adkins).
haller is hired for a high-profile case, representing wealthy louis roulet (ryan phillippe), a beverly hills playboy and son of real estate mogul mary windsor (frances fisher). he is accused of brutally beating prostitute regina campo (margarita levieva), and insists he is the innocent victim of a setup. haller and his investigator, frank levin (william h. macy) analyze photos and evidence and find it similar to a past case, resulting in a life sentence for his client, jesus martinez (michael pea), for murdering a woman, despite his repeated proclamations of innocence.
haller's ex-wife, da maggie mcpherson (marisa tomei), has always disliked him representing guilty clients, though they remain close. he wonders if he was wrong for persuading martinez to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. haller visits martinez, who becomes agitated when h shows him roulet's photo. now believing roulet is the killer in the martinez case, he is bound by attorneyclient confidentiality rules, and unable to reveal what he knows.
roulet breaks into haller's house and nonchalantly admits to committing the murder for which martinez was convicted. he makes veiled threats toward his ex and their daughter. levin is found shot to death after leaving haller a voicemail message claiming he found martinez's "ticket out of jail." haller discovers that his late father's .22 colt woodsman is missing from its box, the same caliber gun that killed levin.
detective lankford (bryan cranston), who dislikes haller, discovers the gun's registration and suspects his involvement in levin's murder. haller is certain that roulet stole the weapon when he broke into his home.
legally obliged to defend his client, guilty or not, haller ruthlessly cross-examines campo and discredits her in the jury's eyes. he then sets up a known prison informant with information on the previous murder. when the informant testifies, haller discredits him, and the state's attorney (josh lucas) can only move to dismiss all charges. roulet is set free, but the police arrest him immediately after for the previous murder, based upon testimony haller coaxed from the informant.
haller acquires a pistol from earl for protection. roulet is released due to lack of evidence and intends to kill haller's ex-wife and daughter. he is waiting at maggie's when roulet arrives. haller vows that he will not stop until martinez is freed and roulet is convicted for his crime; roulet mockingly tells him he cannot guard his family all the time. the bikers whom haller previously represented suddenly arrive and brutally beat roulet.
maggie discovers levin had found a parking ticket issued to roulet near the previous murder victim's house. it is strong evidence against roulet in his pending murder trial and will support martinez's innocence. upon arriving home, haller discovers roulet's mother, mary windsor, waiting inside. she shoots him with the colt woodsman, confessing that she murdered levin to protect her son. when mary moves to shoot haller again, he brandishes the gun obtained from earl and fatally shoots her.
martinez is released, and the da will seek the death penalty for roulet. as haller rides off to his next case, he is pulled over by vogel and the biker gang, whose case he takes pro bono in gratitude for their help.
