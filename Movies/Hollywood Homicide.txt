== plot ==
sergeant joe gavilan is a financially strapped homicide detective with the hollywood division of the lapd. he has been moonlighting as a real estate agent for seven years. his current partner is k. c. calden, a much younger detective who teaches yoga on the side and wants to be an actor. the partners are investigating the murders of the four members of rap group "h2oclick", who were gunned down in a nightclub by two unidentified assailants. the detectives discover there was a witness who fled, and they work to track him down. they are distracted, failing to bond as partners, as gavilan has to deal with a looming real estate deal that may be the key to getting out of debt, while calden further pursues his dreams of acting by trying to be scouted by talent agents.
meanwhile, the manager of h2oclick, antoine sartain, has his head of security eliminate the two hitmen, who he had hired to kill h2oclick, and earlier a rapper named klepto that sartain also managed.
gavilan and calden believe the murders are gang-related, but when calden happens to see the bodies of the hitmen at the morgue, they conclude that the murders were orchestrated. the detectives also notice similarities that tie the h2oclick and klepto homicides together. gavilan learns from an undercover officer that the songwriter for h2oclick, a man named k-ro, has gone missing, leading gavilan to believe he is their murder witness. they struggle to track down k-ro until they finally learn his real name, oliver robideaux, the son of former motown singer olivia robideaux.
meanwhile, internal affairs lieutenant bernard "bennie" macko arrives at the station. macko and gavilan have a bad history, as gavilan embarrassed macko after proving him wrong on a case years ago. the animosity is compounded by the fact that gavilan's latest love interest, a psychic named ruby, used to date macko. macko is intent on ruining gavilan, going so far as to try to frame him and place both detectives in interrogation. instead, it only serves to help gavilan and calden strengthen their partnership. gavilan offers to help calden with the case of his father's death; officer danny calden had been gunned down during a sting operation gone wrong, with his partner, officer leroy wasley, being implicated but eventually released due to lack of evidence.
the partners track down k-ro to his home, where olivia professes her son's innocence and that manager sartain was the real culprit. sartain had been embezzling money from klepto, h2oclick and other clients for years. klepto and h2oclick discovered this and threatened to hire lawyers to nullify their contracts, which led sartain to have his head of security hire the hitmen as a "lesson" to all his clients. it also turns out that wasley is sartain's security chief, and that macko is also in league with him.
when the partners can't locate sartain and wasley, gavilan enlists the help of ruby. she uses her psychic power to lead the two detectives to a clothing store. just then, sartain and wasley happened to drive by, and gavilan and calden follow in a wild car chase. the chase ends with the four men on foot, with the two partners chasing the two culprits in different directions. when gavilan struggles with sartain, sartain ends up falling from the top of a building to his death. wasley has drawn a gun on calden and loudly brags about having killed his father. calden utilizes his acting skills to distract wasley, incapacitate him, and reveals he had a tape recorder on the whole time. gavilan and calden reunite as lapd officers swarm the scene, but macko appears and calls for the arrests of the two officers. instead, macko is arrested for his part in helping to cover up sartain and wasley's crimes.
gavilan and ruby are seen attending a production of a streetcar named desire, in which calden is playing a lead role. it is implied that gavilan successfully brokered the real estate deal, and calden is giving his all in the pursuit of his acting dream. however, both of them receive calls from police headquarters and leave in the middle of the play, now solid partners.

the roles of gavilan and calden were previously given to john travolta and joseph gordon-levitt, respectively, before harrison ford and josh hartnett eventually signed on.
throughout filming, ford and hartnett reportedly did not get along. things apparently got so tense that the two wouldn't look each other in the eye when they're sharing scenes together with ford calling hartnett a "punk" while hartnett responded by calling ford an "old fart". they reportedly carried over the feud into the promotional tour for the film.
