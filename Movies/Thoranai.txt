=== critical response ===
tamil versionbehindwoods wrote:"thoranai does entertain, but a tighter script and better execution could have yielded far better results". sify wrote:"the problems with thoranai are sundry. first and foremost, its got a dead script. nothing, simply nothing happens in the first half of the film". rediff wrote:"thoranai's only merit is that it's marginally better than sathyam. the times of india gave the film two stars and wrote that "it is a formidable star cast that you see in 'thoranai'. however, what is missing is a convincing story".
telugu versionthe times of india gave the film one and a half stars out of five stating that "inspite of a dud like salute, tamil star vishal hasn't realised the significance of a solid plot even for a star-centric film."
