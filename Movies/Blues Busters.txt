== plot ==
sach develops an uncanny ability to sing, after having his tonsils removed, and slip convinces louie to turn his sweet shop into a night club, the bowery palace, after unsuccessfully trying to get sach a singing job at a neighboring club, the rio cabana.
after sach's singing makes him a star, rick martin, the owner of the now-rival club, tries to hire him away but is unsuccessful.  rick gets his lady friend, lola, to get sach to sign a contract with him, using the pretense that she is asking for his autograph.  rick then goes after the bowery palace's other star, sally dolan.  she, however, does not want to go because rick is after more than just her singing talent.  she tips off lola about what rick is up to and lola agrees to testify that sach's signature was just an autograph and not a signed contract, thereby allowing him to return to the bowery palace.  however, by this time sach has gone to a doctor to help cure the "tickle in his throat' and he has lost the ability to sing.
