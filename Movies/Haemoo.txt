== critical reception ==
the review aggregator rotten tomatoes reported that 77% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 6.17/10. on metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 6 critic reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". the hollywood reporter described the film as "a possible riveting nightmare fogged up by concessions to blockbuster conventions." it praised hong kyung-pyo's cinematography and lee ha-joon's production design as "effective in highlighting the differences between the lands of vast, cold port and the unforgiving environments of the sea and cramped insides of the fishing boat," but criticized director shim sung-bo's lack of subtlety and reflection, "with haemoo subscribing to many of the conventions of both disaster epics and revenge drama, and the over-dependence of a central seaborne romance."variety wrote, "turning a real-life human trafficking tragedy into a comment on social inequality and the cost of survival, haemoo dramatizes a stark nautical ordeal fraught with tension. produced and co-written by internationally recognized korean auteur bong joon-ho (snowpiercer, the host) this directing debut by helmer-scribe shim sung-bo echoes bong's trademark cynical vision of human nature, but the characters lack dimensionality and psychological depth."
