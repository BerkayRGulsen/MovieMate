arthur lions notes in death on the cheap: the lost b movies of film noir, "a top-notch cast is wasted in a total clunker. the film takes the award, however, for the movie with the shortest performance by a top-billed star. leading man tone, after his brief initial appearance, spends most of the picture as the "corpse" in the laundry room."the film was entered into the 1949 cannes film festival.
