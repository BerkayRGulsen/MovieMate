== critical reception ==
the movie scene wrote, "impact" is the sort of old british movie which you stumble across one day on one of those channels which appear well down the list which some people don't even know exist. it is also one of those movies which you start watching and an hour later it is over and you can't remember a great deal of what has happened. the reason why is that it is devoid of excitement and seems to have been made hastily on limited funds forcing the writer to use lots of dialogue to explain things rather than showing it"; while the radio times wrote "...this programme filler, produced in a matter of days on a shoestring budget, contains no surprises in the plot...maxwell just about keeps what action there is ticking over, but he is fighting a losing battle with a cast that is substandard, even for a british b-movie"; whereas sky movies called it a "lively thriller about a reporter who wages a vendetta against a treacherous soho gangster. george pastell, as the villain, and anita west, as a moll, give competent performances."
