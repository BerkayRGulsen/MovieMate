== reception ==
the blatant sexuality of muck polarized audiences and critics, but the film nevertheless received major distribution. as one reviewer put it, against all odds anchor bay entertainment distributed the film. the independent horror film was highly anticipated and widely reviewed, including by reviewers at the los angeles times, the village voice, bloody disgusting, and the fright file.
while critics generally agreed that the overt sexuality of the film was an attempt for muck to be "a throwback to old-school horror," reviews were mixed, as some critics found mucks focus on sex distracting but praised the movie's look and camerawork. others saw the films scantily-clad characters as an attraction. ain't it cool news wrote "about as subtle as a stripper in church, dont expect your brain to be stimulated, but other areas (specifically your guts and below) are bound to be rumbled when you wade through muck."on rotten tomatoes, the film has a 0% approval based on 7 reviews.
