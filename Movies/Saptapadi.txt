== plot ==
the story takes place in pre-independent india (early 1940) when young indian students were competing equally with anglo-indians in all fields whether it be education or sports. krishnendu (uttam kumar), a young bengali hindu medical student falls in love with an equally talented and attractive anglo-indian christian woman named rina brown (suchitra sen). both students are at the calcutta medical college and become close while meeting at many sports and cultural events. there is an interesting rendition of othello within the movie; that portion of the movie was directed by utpal dutt. however marriage is not on the cards for them due to their differences in religion, (it is particularly opposed by krishnendu's dad, a staunch, conservative hindu), and they go their own ways only to unexpectedly meet again later in life.
most of the movie is presented in flashbacks with krishnendu pondering over the past after unexpectedly encountering a drunk and passed out rina in a military hospital in returns.
