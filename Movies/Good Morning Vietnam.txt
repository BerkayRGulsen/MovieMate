== plot ==
in 1965, airman second class adrian cronauer arrives in saigon to work as a dj for armed forces radio service. private edward garlick takes him to the radio station, where his attitude and demeanor contrast sharply with those of many staff members. his show consists of reading strictly censored news and irreverent humor segments mixed with rock and roll music, which is frowned upon by his superiors, second lieutenant steven hauk and sergeant major phillip dickerson. hauk adheres to strict army guidelines in terms of humor and music programming while dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. however, brigadier general taylor and the other djs quickly grow to like cronauer and his eccentric brand of comedy.
cronauer follows trinh, a vietnamese girl, to an english class; after bribing the teacher to let him take over, cronauer instructs the students in american slang. once class is dismissed, he tries to talk to trinh but is stopped by her brother tuan; realizing the futility of pursuing her, cronauer instead befriends tuan and takes him to jimmy wah's, a local gi bar. two soldiers, angered at tuan's presence, initiate a confrontation that escalates into a brawl.
dickerson reprimands cronauer for the incident. while relaxing in jimmy wah's one afternoon, he is pulled outside by tuan, saying that trinh wants to see him. moments later, the building explodes, killing two soldiers and leaving cronauer shaken. the cause of the explosion is determined to be a bomb; dickerson declares the news censored, but cronauer locks himself in the studio and reports it anyway, to dickerson's outrage. dickerson cuts off the broadcast and cronauer is suspended, to the delight of hauk and dickerson. hauk takes over the show, but his poor attempts at humor and polka music choices lead to a flood of letters and phone calls demanding that cronauer be reinstated.
demoralized, cronauer spends his time drinking and pursuing trinh, only to be repeatedly rebuffed. at the radio station, taylor intervenes, ordering hauk to reinstate cronauer, but he refuses to go back to work. garlick and cronauer's vehicle is stopped in a congested street amidst a convoy of soldiers from the 1st infantry division heading for nha trang, where garlick persuades him to do an impromptu "broadcast" before they go off to fight. the soldiers' appreciation reminds cronauer why his job is important, and he returns to work.
dickerson seizes an opportunity to permanently rid himself of cronauer by approving his request to interview soldiers in the field and routing him through the viet cong-controlled highway to an lc. cronauer and garlick's jeep hits a mine, and they are forced to hide from vc patrols. in saigon, tuan learns of the trip after cronauer fails to show up for english class and steals a van to go after them. after finding them, the van breaks down and they flag down a marine helicopter to take them back to the city.
back at the base, dickerson tells cronauer that he is off the air for good after tuan is revealed as a vc operative known as "phan duc to" and the one responsible for the bombing of jimmy wah's; dickerson has arranged for cronauer's honorable discharge. general taylor informs cronauer that, regrettably, he cannot help him since his friendship with tuan would damage the reputation of the us army. after cronauer leaves, taylor informs dickerson that he is being transferred to guam, citing his vindictive attitude as the reason.
cronauer chases down tuan, decrying his actions against american soldiers. emerging from the shadows, tuan retorts that the us army devastated his hometown, resulting in the deaths of most of his family and his friends, thereby making the united states his enemy.  before disappearing back into the jungle, tuan reminds cronauer that in spite of this, he still saved his life in an loc, implying that he valued his friendship in spite of opposing sides. on his way to the tan son nhat airport with garlick, under mp escort, cronauer sets up a quick softball game for the students from his english class (which he promised to do for them, and even the mps join in) and says goodbye to trinh, parting ways as friends. he gives garlick a taped farewell message and boards the plane to take him back home to queens; garlick  taking cronauer's place as dj  plays the tape on the air the next morning, which opens with cronauer saying "goodbye, vietnam!"

== production ==
in 1979, adrian cronauer pitched a sitcom based on his experiences as an afrs dj. although one of the most popular television programs of the era was a korean war period piece titled m*a*s*h, the networks were not interested, because they did not see war as comedy material. cronauer then revamped his sitcom into a script for a tv movie of the week, which eventually got the attention of robin williams. very little of cronauer's original treatment remained after writer mitch markowitz was brought in.commenting on the accuracy of the film, the real-life cronauer commented "i'm very happy with it. of course, it was never intended to be an accurate point-by-point biography. it was intended as a piece of entertainment, and (williams) was playing a character named adrian cronauer who shared a lot of my experiences. but actually, he was playing robin williams." commenting on his portrayal in the film, cronauer said "anybody who has been in the military will tell you that if i did half the things in that movie, id still be in leavenworth right now. a lot of hollywood imagination went into the movie. i was a disc jockey in vietnam and i did teach english in my spare time. i was not thrown out of vietnam; i stayed for my full one-year tour and i was honorably discharged." none of the people in the film are based on actual people cronauer met, although he described them as stereotypes of military personnel who existed at the time. the scenes where cronauer teaches his class to swear and use "street slang", his pursuit of a vietnamese woman, and his jeep being blown up in the jungle, among others, are constructs for the plot and never happened to cronauer. he did, however, witness the bombing of a restaurant he had only recently left, and clash with army censors when prevented from reporting it.according to cronauer, he and williams were forbidden by levinson to meet each other because the director "was afraid that if robin and i met, that robin would somehow start to do an unconscious imitation of me, which would change his characterization." williams and cronauer eventually met at the film's new york premiere.
