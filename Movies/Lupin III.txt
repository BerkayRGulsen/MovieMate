lupin iii (japanese: , hepburn: rupan sansei), also written as lupin the third, lupin the 3rd or lupin the iiird, is a japanese manga series written and illustrated by monkey punch. it follows the escapades of master thief arsne lupin iii, the grandson of arsne lupin, the gentleman thief of maurice leblanc's series of novels.
the lupin iii manga, which first appeared in weekly manga action on august 10, 1967, spawned a media franchise that includes numerous manga, two versions of an animated pilot film, six animated television series, eleven theatrically-released animated films, two live-action films, five ova works, twenty-seven animated television specials, two musicals, many music cds, and several video games. many different companies have owned the english-language distribution rights to various lupin iii properties at various times, with just the first two animated films having been released by over 10 companies alone. tokyopop acquired the license to the original manga in 2002, and later the second series in 2004. funimation entertainment purchased the rights to several of the television specials and films in 2002, and the fourth television series in 2012. geneon licensed and dubbed 79 episodes of the second television series, 26 of which were broadcast on cartoon network's adult swim during 2003. discotek media licensed the entire first, second, third, fourth and fifth television series and the first live-action film; they also own the rights to several other lupin titles, including some previously released by other companies.
over fifty years after its creation, lupin iii remains popular, with a sixth anime series airing in 2018. critical reception of the franchise has been largely positive across its various incarnations, with the appeal of the lead characters being noted as the primary factor of the series' success. the voice acting (in both japanese and english versions) and soundtracks (especially those composed by yuji ohno) of the anime adaptations have also received similar compliments; however, several of the franchise's installments, most specifically the television specials, have been criticized for being formulaic. the manga has also been noted by fans and critics for its darker tone compared to the anime, with its explicit depictions of sex and violence, as well as its black, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor, contrasting with the mostly family-friendly animated versions. for several years, issues relating to the copyright of maurice leblanc's intellectual property meant that the lupin name was removed from its releases outside japan, usually changed to "rupan" or "wolf". however, the copyright has since expired, allowing foreign releases to use the lupin name.


== premise ==

arsne lupin iii, the grandson of the fictional gentleman thief, arsne lupin, is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to their owners. his right-hand man and best friend is daisuke jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. although lupin and jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by goemon ishikawa xiii, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, and fujiko mine, a femme fatale and lupin's love interest. although fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. lupin and his gang are constantly chased by inspector koichi zenigata of interpol, who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing lupin across the globe.


== production ==

the series was created in 1965 by japanese manga artist kazuhiko kat under the pen name monkey punch. his inspiration for the series was the fictional french gentleman thief arsne lupin, created by maurice leblanc. before creating the series he read 15 of leblanc's stories. the aim of the lupin iii series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected the traits of leblanc's character. originally the intention was to keep the blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however he was convinced by others not to do so.monkey punch combined elements of arsne lupin with james bond to develop the character of lupin iii and made him a "carefree fellow". lupin was given a red color jacket which monkey punch believes is a flashy, sexy color. as the series was to be published in a magazine targeted at adults, fujiko mine was created to add a female presence and to fulfill a "bond girl" role. her name was inspired by a picture of mount fuji, monkey punch added the -ko female suffix to create her first name, and chose "mine" for her family name because of its meaning as "summit". at the beginning of the series, many of the women lupin encounters are all named fujiko, but are treated as different characters from chapter to chapter. creating a new female character each week was too difficult for monkey punch so she evolved into a single character who changes style frequently. jigen was based on james coburn, especially his role in the magnificent seven, and his name was chosen to reflect his unconventional personality. goemon was created to give an east asian element into an otherwise western series. despite lupin and goemon originally being enemies, monkey punch decided that they were on the same wavelength. while lupin, fujiko, jigen and goemon frequently operate together for their own goals, the author considers them not to be a true group as they have their own individual interests. in the manga they operated individually, however in the anime adaptations the group tend to work together. inspector zenigata was conceived as lupin's archrival to create a "human tom and jerry".when monkey punch began lupin iii, he was already working on another series, pinky punky. monkey punch enjoys writing outlaw characters, and both lupin iii and pinky punky made use of outlaws as central characters. according to him, this made it easy for him to write two series without much pressure. monkey punch enjoys puzzles and mysteries such as columbo and agatha christie novels, and was also inspired by the three musketeers and the movies of alfred hitchcock. he believes the characters of lupin and fujiko are similar to the characters of d'artagnan and milady de winter, and describes them as "not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other". another influence on the manga was mad magazine. monkey punch said the appeal of drawing lupin comes from the character being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. however, this is contrasted by the appeal of zenigata's strict personality. originally the series was only expected to last three months, but due to its popularity, monkey punch continued to draw it. however, despite his happiness at its success, he has expressed confusion over its popularity.monkey punch has said that he believes the story can never end but that if he had to, both zenigata and lupin would have to end as equals. they would either both fail, both win or both get very old.


== copyright issues ==
monkey punch did not ask permission to use the arsne lupin name and at the time japan did not enforce trade copyrights. by the time leblanc's estate launched legal action in japan, the name was considered to have entered into common use. however, this was not the case in north america and europe and several foreign releases of lupin iii media dropped the lupin iii title and the character himself was renamed to "rupan" or "wolf". in france, the series was known as edgar, detective cambrioleur (edgar, detective burglar) with lupin himself renamed "edgar de la cambriole" (edgar of burglary). monkey punch has stated that using the same character design, behavior and face would be illegal, but using a name alone is not illegal. in 2012, leblanc's original arsne lupin entered the public domain in france due to 70 years passing since his death in 1941, and is in the public domain for any country that enforces the rule of the shorter term.

however, he felt that the art was too primitive. otaku usas daryl surat was also put off by the art, saying he couldn't tell most character apart and had a hard time figuring out what he was looking at. in the rough guide to manga, jason s. yadao highlighted the example of how lupin wearing a hat looks exactly like zenigata. however, he considered it a successful plot device in once chapter that while it may take several attempts to understand, eventually pays off. he included the series in his list of 50 essential manga. many of the first volumes of the english edition of the lupin iii manga released by tokyopop made it onto icv2's list of top 50 graphic novels, as well as later volumes from the series.in anime classics zettai!, brian clamp and julie davis compare the first two anime adaptions. they note that the first series is of a serious style, closer to the original manga with a dark tone and that it focuses on disputes between lupin and other criminals. in contrast they sum up the second series as a caper comedy with a more comedic tone and style. both chris beveridge of mania.com and mike crandol of ann disliked the dub of the second television series because pioneer entertainment used many modern references and updated dialogue for a series that was released in the late 1970s, although the series itself received a positive overall review from both reviewers. rob lineberger of dvd verdict wrote, "lupin the third is james bond meets charlie's angels with scooby-doo sensibilities." monkey punch believes that the voice work of yasuo yamada was a large reason for the popularity of the anime series.chris beveridge of mania.com gave the castle of cagliostro an "a+", although he disliked manga entertainment's use of pg-13 level language in the english dub. while the film was not initially a box-office success, it gained popularity through numerous re-releases and was even voted as "the best anime in history" by the readers of animage. the film was the best-selling anime dvd in may 2001, and the third best selling in june. some fans maintain that it is not a "true" lupin title, due to miyazaki's altering of the titular character into a family-friendly hero, rather than his original ruthless criminal self. while admitting that cagliostro is the most well-known, ann's mike crandol cited the fuma conspiracy as the best lupin animation.the lupin iii television specials released by funimation have received reviews varying from positive to mixed. the most well-received seems to be island of assassins, with chris beveridge of mania.com describing it as "the best non-tv lupin experience ... since the castle of cagliostro", missed by a dollar received an eight out of ten rating by ign's jeremy mullin, who stated it starts off as seemingly a simple heist film, but turns out to have plenty of twists. the least well-received of funimation's releases is secret of the twilight gemini, which received mixed reviews due to the animation and its b movie-style plot. mania.com gave 2002's episode 0: first contact an a+ and hailed it as the best tv special made to date. in 500 essential anime movies helen mccarthy called liberty her personal favourite of the lupin tv specials. she describes it as "light, funny and entertaining" and "terrific entertainment".critical reception of the 2014 live-action film was generally negative among japanese and western film critics, especially following the film's showing at la eigafest. areas frequently targeted for criticism were ryuhei kitamura's direction, the film's supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. the film was also criticized for having most of its dialogue performed in english (resulting in poor delivery and intonation of numerous lines by its asian cast members), and for overall squandering its potential as an adaptation of monkey punch's manga. shun oguri, tetsuji tamayama, g ayano, meisa kuroki and tadanobu asano were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their respective roles. audience opinions were mixed, with some viewing the film as an enjoyable time to be had to the whole family, while others viewed it as part of a terrible live-action adaptation trend that has been going on through the years.
