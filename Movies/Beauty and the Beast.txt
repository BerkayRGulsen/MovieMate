== plot ==
an enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle during a ball and offers the host, a cruel and selfish prince, a rose in return for shelter from a storm. when he refuses, she reveals her identity. as punishment for the prince's lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects before then erasing the castle, himself, and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone else in the town. she casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that if he can learn to love another and be loved in return before the last petal falls, the spell will be broken. otherwise, he will be doomed to remain a beast for the remainder of his days.
some years later, in the small town of villeneuve, belle, the book-loving daughter of a widowed artist named maurice, dreams of adventure. she constantly brushes off advances from gaston, an arrogant former soldier as he is not the type of man belle wishes to marry. on maurice's way to the market, he becomes lost in the forest and seeks refuge in the beast's castle. however, the beast imprisons him when he "stole" a rose from his garden as a gift to belle. when maurice's horse returns without him, belle ventures out in search of him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. belle tricks her father and the beast by asking for a simple hug goodbye from her father, she pushes him out and locks herself in the dungeon. the beast agrees to let her take her father's place and forces maurice to leave immediately.
belle befriends the castle's servants, including candelabra/footman lumiere, mantel clock/majordomo cogsworth, feather-duster/maid plumette, teapot/housekeeper mrs. potts, and her son, chip, who is now a teacup. they invite her to a spectacular dinner. when she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the beast scares her into the woods. belle is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the beast rescues her, becoming injured in the process. as belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. the beast shows belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in paris, where she discovers a plague doctor's mask and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the plague.
in villeneuve, maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the beast and belle's imprisonment. gaston, seeing rescuing belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help maurice. when maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. maurice is rescued by the town hermit agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, gaston convinces them to send maurice to an insane asylum.
after sharing a romantic dance with the beast, belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. the beast releases her to save maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. at villeneuve, belle reveals the beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. realizing that belle loves the beast, a jealous gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. he rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the beast before he curses the whole village. inside the asylum carriage, belle tells her father that she knows what happened to her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home. maurice and belle escape, and belle rushes back to the castle.
during the battle, gaston abandons his companion lefou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. meanwhile, he attacks the beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing belle return. he defeats gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with belle. however, gaston treacherously shoots the beast from a bridge, which then collapses as the castle begins to crumble, leading gaston to fall to his death. the beast then dies as the last petal falls and the servants become inanimate objects.
as belle tearfully professes her love to the beast, agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, restoring the beast and his servants to their human forms and to the villagers' memories. the prince and belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.

== production ==


=== development ===
previously, disney had begun work on a film adaptation of the 1994 broadway musical. however, in a 2011 interview, composer alan menken stated the planned film version of the beauty and the beast stage musical "was canned".by april 2014, walt disney pictures had already begun developing a new live-action version of beauty and the beast after making other live-action fantasy films such as alice in wonderland, maleficent, cinderella, and the jungle book. two months later, bill condon signed on to direct the film from a script by evan spiliotopoulos. later in september of that same year, stephen chbosky (who directed emma watson in the perks of being a wallflower) was hired to re-write the script.before condon was hired to direct the film, disney approached him with a proposal to remake the film in a more radical way as universal studios had remade snow white and the huntsman (2012). condon later explained that "after frozen opened, the studio saw that there was this big international audience for an old-school-musical approach. but initially, they said, 'we're interested in a musical to a degree, but only half full of songs.' my interest was taking that film and doing it in this new mediumlive-actionas a full-on musical movie. so i backed out for a minute, and they came back and said, 'no, no, no, we get it, let's pursue it that way.'" walt disney pictures president of production sean bailey credited walt disney studios chairman alan f. horn with the decision to make the film as a musical: "we worked on this for five or six years, and for 18 months to two years, beauty was a serious dramatic project, and the scripts were written to reflect that. it wasn't a musical at that time. but we just couldn't get it to click and it was alan horn who championed the idea of owning the disney of it all. we realized there was a competitive advantage in the songs. what is wrong with making adults feel like kids again?" the film's ending originally featured gaston being cursed by the enchantress, though the idea was scrapped.


=== casting ===
in january 2015, it was announced that emma watson had been cast as belle, the female lead. she was the first and only choice of walt disney studios chairman alan f. horn, who had previously run warner bros. which released the eight harry potter films that starred watson as hermione granger. two months later, luke evans and dan stevens were reported to be in talks to play gaston and the beast respectively, and watson confirmed their casting the next day on twitter. the rest of the principal cast, including josh gad, emma thompson, kevin kline, audra mcdonald, ian mckellen, gugu mbatha-raw, ewan mcgregor, and stanley tucci were announced between march and april to play lefou, mrs. potts, maurice, madame de garderobe, cogsworth, plumette, lumire, and cadenza, respectively.susan egan, who originated the role of belle on broadway, commented on the casting of watson as "perfect". paige o'hara, who voiced belle in the original animated film and its sequels, offered to help watson with her singing lessons.according to the hollywood reporter, watson was reportedly paid $3 million upfront, together with an agreement that her final take-home pay could rise as high as $15 million if the film generated gross box office income similar to maleficent's $759 million worldwide gross.


=== filming ===
principal photography began on may 18, 2015, taking place at shepperton studios in surrey, england, nearby in the village of cranleigh, and in lacock, wiltshire. filming with the principal actors concluded on august 21. six days later, co-producer jack morrissey confirmed that production had officially wrapped.the beast was portrayed with a "more traditional motion capture puppeteering for the body and the physical orientation", where actor dan stevens was "in a forty-pound gray suit on stilts for much of the film". the facial capture for the beast was done separately in order to "communicate the subtleties of the human face" and "[capture the] thought that occurs to him" which gets "through [to] the eyes, which are the last human element in the beast." the castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with cgi animation.prior to the film's release, bill condon refilmed one certain sequence in the "days of the sun" number, due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress harriet jones, who looked similar to hattie morahan, who portrayed agathe. in the original version of the scene, it was jones' character, the prince's mother, who sings the first verse of the song, with rudi goodman playing the young prince and henry garrett playing his father; but in the reshot version of the scene, the singing part is given to the prince (now played by adam mitchell). the king was also recast to tom turner, although harriet jones was still the queen, albeit with dark hair. both goodman and garrett's names were mistakenly featured in the original theatrical release's credits, but was later corrected in home releases.


=== music ===

when released in 1991, beauty and the beast marked a turning point for walt disney pictures by appealing to millions of fans with its academy award-winning musical score by lyricist howard ashman and composer alan menken. in bill condon's opinion, that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live-action version of the film. "that score had more to reveal", he says, "you look at the songs and there's not a clunker in the group. in fact, frank rich described it as the best broadway musical of 1991. the animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous disney fairy-tales. take that vision, put it into a new medium, make it a radical reinvention, something not just for the stage because it's not just being literal, now other elements come into play. it's not just having real actors do it".condon initially prepared on only drawing inspiration from the original film, but he also planned to include most of the songs composed by menken, ashman and tim rice from the broadway musical, with the intention of making the film as a "straight-forward, live-action, large-budget movie musical". menken returned to score the film's music, which features songs from the original film by him and ashman, plus new material written by menken and rice. menken said the film would not include songs that were written for the broadway musical and, instead, created four new songs. however, an instrumental version of the song "home", which was written for the musical, is used during the scene where belle first enters her room in the castle.on january 19, 2017, both disney and celine dion  singer of the original 1991 "beauty and the beast" duet song, with singer peabo bryson  confirmed that dion would be performing one of the new original songs "how does a moment last forever" to play over the end titles. she originally had doubts about whether or not to record the song due to the recent death of her husband and manager ren anglil, who had previously helped her secure the 1991 pop duet. while ultimately accepting the opportunity, she said: "[the] first beauty and the beast decision was made with my husband. now i'm making decisions on my own. it's a little bit harder. i couldn't say yes right away, because i felt like i was kind of cheating in a way". she eventually felt compelled to record the song because of the impact beauty and the beast has had on her career. according to dion, "i was at the beginning of my career, it put me on the map, it put me where i am today". also, josh groban was announced to be performing the new original song "evermore" six days later.the 2017 film features a remake of the 1991 original song recorded as a duet by ariana grande and john legend. grande and legend's updated version of the title song is faithful to the original, grammy-winning duet, performed by celine dion and peabo bryson for the 1991 disney film. 
disney debuted the music video for ariana grande and john legend's interpretation of the title song on freeform television network on march 5, 2017, and it has since been viewed over 250 million times on the vevo video-hosting service.emma thompson also performed the title song, which was performed by angela lansbury in the original 1991 animated film.

=== critical response ===
beauty and the beast received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going to its visuals, ensemble cast, musical score, songs, costume design, production values, and faithfulness to the original animated film with a few elements of the broadway musical version, while the designs of the beast and the servants' household object forms drew mixed reviews. on review aggregator rotten tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71% based on 379 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. the website's critical consensus reads, "with an enchanting cast, beautifully crafted songs, and a painterly eye for detail, beauty and the beast offers a faithful yet fresh retelling that honors its beloved source material." on metacritic, the film has a score of 65 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". in cinemascore polls, audiences gave the film an average grade of "a" on an a+ to f scale.leslie felperin of the hollywood reporter wrote: "it's a michelin-triple-starred master class in patisserie skills that transforms the cinematic equivalent of a sugar rush into a kind of crystal-meth-like narcotic high that lasts about two hours." felperin also praised the performances of watson and kline as well the special effects, costume designs and the sets, while commending the inclusion of gad's character of lefou as the first lgbt character in disney. owen gleiberman of variety, in his positive review of the film, wrote: "it's a lovingly crafted movie, and in many ways a good one, but before that it's an enraptured piece of old-is-new nostalgia." gleiberman compared stevens' portrayal of the beast to a royal version of the titular character in the elephant man and the 1946 version of the beast in jean cocteau's original adaptation. a. o. scott of the new york times praised the performances of both watson and stevens, and wrote: "it looks good, moves gracefully and leaves a clean and invigorating aftertaste. i almost didn't recognize the flavor: i think the name for it is joy."likewise, the washington post's ann hornaday commended watson's performance, describing it as "alert and solemn" while deeming her singing abilities "serviceable enough to get the job done". richard roeper of the chicago sun-times awarded the film three and a half out of five and lauded the performances of watson and thompson which he drew a comparison to paige o'hara's and angela lansbury's performances in the 1991 animated version while appreciating the performances of the other cast.  he also commented on the advantage of its using both motion capture and cgi technology, writing: "almost overwhelmingly lavish, beautifully staged and performed with exquisite timing and grace by the outstanding cast". mike ryan of uproxx praised the cast, production design and the new songs while noting the film doesn't try anything different, saying: "there's certainly nothing that new about this version of beauty and the beast (well, except it isn't a cartoon anymore), but it's a good recreation of a classic animated film that should leave most die-hards satisfied." in her a- review, nancy churnin of the dallas morning news praised the film's emotional and thematic depth, remarking: "there's an emotional authenticity in director bill condon's live-action beauty and the beast film that helps you rediscover disney's beloved 1991 animated film and 1994 stage show in fresh, stirring ways." james berardinelli of reelviews described the 2017 version as "enthralling".brian truitt of usa today commended the performances of evans, gad, mcgregor and thompson alongside condon's affinity with musicals, the production design, visual effects featured in some of the song numbers including new songs made by the composers alan menken and tim rice, particularly evermore which he described the new song with a potential for an academy award for best original song. peter travers of rolling stone rated the film three out of four, deeming it an "exhilarating gift" while he remarked that "beauty and the beast does justice to disney's animated classic, even if some of the magic is m.i.a (missing in action)". stephanie zacharek of time magazine gave a positive review with a description as "wild, vivid and crazy-beautiful" as she wrote "nearly everything about beauty and the beast is larger than life, to the point that watching it can be a little overwhelming." and added that "it's loaded with feeling, almost like a brash interpretive dance expressing the passion and elation little girls (and some boys, too) must have felt upon seeing the earlier version." the san francisco chronicle's mick lasalle struck an affirmative tone, calling it one of the joys of 2017, stating that "beauty and the beast creates an air of enchantment from its first moments, one that lingers and builds and takes on qualities of warmth and generosity as it goes along" while referring the film as "beautiful" and also praised the film for its emotional and psychological tone as well steven's motion capture performance.tim robey of the daily telegraph gave the film four out of five and wrote that "it dazzles on this chocolate box of a picture that feels almost greedy yet to make this film work, down to a sugar-rush finale to grasp the nettle and make an out-an-out, bells-and-whistles musical" while he praised the performances of watson, mckellen, thompson, mcgregor, evans and gad. mark hughes of forbes also praised the film, which he wrote "could revive the story in a faithful but entirely new and unique way elevating the material beyond expectations, establishing itself as a cinematic equal to the original.  he also complimented the importance of undertaking a renowned yet problematic masterpiece as well addressing changes in the elements of the story while acknowledging the film's effectiveness in resonating to the audiences.several critics regarded the film as inferior to its 1991 animated predecessor. david sims of the atlantic wrote that the 2017 film "feels particularly egregious, in part, because it's so slavishly devoted to the original; every time it falls short of its predecessor (which is quite often), it's hard not to notice". michael phillips of the chicago tribune said that the 2017 film "takes our knowledge and our interest in the material for granted. it zips from one number to another, throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen, charmlessly." phillips wrote that the film featured some "less conspicuously talented" performers who are "stuck doing karaoke, or motion-capture work of middling quality", though he praised kline's performance as the "best, sweetest thing in the movie; he brings a sense of calm, droll authority". peter bradshaw of the guardian praised watson's performance and wrote that the film was "lit in that fascinatingly artificial honey-glow light, and it runs smoothly on railsthe kind of rails that bring in and out the stage sets for the lucrative broadway touring version." in the same newspaper, wendy ide criticized the film as "ornate to the point of desperation" in its attempt to emulate the animated film.chris nashawaty of entertainment weekly gave the film a b-, writing that the new songs were "not transporting". he felt the film needed more life and depth, but praised watson's performance as the "one of the film's stronger elements". dana schwartz of the new york observer felt that some of the characters, such as gaston and the beast, had been watered down from the 1991 film, and that the additional backstory elements failed to "advance the plot or theme in any meaningful way" while adding considerable bloat. schwartz considered the singing of the cast to be adequate but felt that their voices should have been dubbed over, especially for the complex songs.

== controversies ==


=== gay character ===
controversy arose after director bill condon said there was a "gay moment" in the film, when lefou briefly waltzes with stanley, one of gaston's friends. afterwards in an interview with vulture, condon stated, "can i just say, i'm sort of sick of this. because you've seen the movieit's such a tiny thing, and it's been overblown." condon also added that beauty and the beast features much more diversity than just the highly talked-about lefou: "that was so important. we have interracial couplesthis is a celebration of everybody's individuality, and that's what's exciting about it." glaad president and ceo sarah kate ellis praised the move, stating, "it is a small moment in the film, but it is a huge leap forward for the film industry."in russia, vitaly milonov agitated the culture minister for banning the film, but instead it was given a 16+ rating (children under the age of 16 can only be admitted to see it in theaters with accompanying adults). additionally, a theater in henagar, alabama did not screen the film because of the subplot. in malaysia, the film censorship board insisted the "gay moment" scene be cut, prompting an indefinite postponement of its release by disney, followed by their decision to withdraw it completely if it could not be released uncensored. the studio moved the release date to march 30, to allow more time for malaysia's censor board to make a decision on whether or not to release the film without changes. the distributors and producers then submitted an appeal to the film appeal committee of malaysia, which allowed the film to be released without any cuts and a p13 rating on the grounds that "the gay element was minor and did not affect the positive elements featured in the film". in kuwait, the film was withdrawn from cinemas by national cinema company, which owns most of the cinemas in the country. a board member of the company stated that the ministry of information's censorship department had requested it to stop its screening and edit it for things the ministry deemed offensive.the film also received criticism over its portrayal of lefou, as many felt that it was used as a way of teasing lgbt+ viewers without providing adequate representation, with his "exclusively gay moment" being his three seconds' dancing with another man at the end of the film.


=== belle and the beast's relationship ===
disney has sought to portray belle as an empowered young woman, but a debate questioning whether it is possible for a captor to fall in love with their prisoner, and whether this is a problematic theme, has resulted. as was the case with the original animated film, one argument is that belle suffers from stockholm syndrome (a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity). emma watson studied whether belle is trapped in an abusive relationship with the beast before signing on and concluded that she does not think the criticism fits this version of the folk tale. watson described stockholm syndrome as "where a prisoner will take on the characteristics of and fall in love with the captor." she went on to say that "belle actively argues and disagrees with [the beast] constantly. she has none of the characteristics of someone with stockholm [s]yndrome because she keeps her independence, she keeps that freedom of thought", further adding that belle defiantly "gives as good as she gets" before forming a friendship and romance with the beast.psychiatrist frank ochberg, who was responsible for defining the term "stockholm syndrome", said he does not think belle exhibits the trauma symptoms of prisoners suffering from the syndrome because she does not go through a period of feeling that she is going to die. some therapists, while acknowledging that the pairing's relationship does not meet the clinical definition of stockholm syndrome, argue that the relationship depicted is dysfunctional and abusive and does not model healthy romantic relationships for young viewers. following this viewpoint, constance grady of vox stated that jeanne-marie leprince de beaumont's beauty and the beast was a fairy tale originally written to prepare young girls in 18th-century france for arranged marriages, and that the power disparity is amplified in the disney version. additionally, anna menta of elite daily argued that the beast does not apologize to belle for imprisoning, hurting, or manipulating her, and that his treatment of belle is not painted as wrong.


== future ==


=== potential follow-up film ===
shortly after the release of the film, sean bailey said that walt disney pictures will "explore possible [live-action] spin-off and prequel scenarios" for animated and live-action disney films, including beauty and the beast. emma watson and dan stevens have both expressed interest in reprising their roles in a potential sequel or prequel to the film.


=== spin-off/prequel series ===

on march 6, 2020, abc signature studios announced to develop a spin-off/prequel limited series to the film focused on gaston and lefou, for disney+. luke evans and josh gad will reprise their roles from the film, and will executive-produce the series alongside eddy kitsis and adam horowitz, with gad, kitsis and horowitz serving as showrunners and writers for the series. alan menken was reported to be in talks to return as composer for the series, which he confirmed in april. the series will be titled little town.
