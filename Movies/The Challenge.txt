== critical reception ==
tv guide wrote, "most of the actors, with the exception of quayle, are pretty stiff, and the story is hardly inspired."
sky movies noted, "filled with such familiar leading men of british 'b' features as peter reynolds, edward judd, dermot walsh and patrick holt. some of the best moments, though, are provided by hollywood's jayne mansfield as the criminal mastermind, demure in black wig and horn-rimmed glasses as she does her 'firm's' books by day, but slinking around in sequins by night with a smile and a song."
