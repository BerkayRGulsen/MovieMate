== plot ==
wyatt frame (alan cumming), an executive with the pop music record label megarecords, is confronted on a private jet by successful boy band dujour over a strange backing track they have discovered on their recent single. wyatt and the plane's pilot parachute out of the jet, leaving it to crash with the band still on board.
landing outside of the town of riverdale, wyatt begins searching for a replacement band for dujour, eventually discovering struggling local rock band the pussycats: lead vocalist and guitarist josie mccoy (rachael leigh cook), drummer melody valentine (tara reid), and bassist valerie brown (rosario dawson). the group accept wyatt's immediate offer of a major record deal despite its seeming implausibility, and they are flown to new york city with their manager alexander (paul costanzo), his sister alexandra (missi pyle), and josie's friend alan m (gabriel mann). wyatt renames the band "josie and the pussycats" without their permission.
meanwhile, megarecords ceo fiona (parker posey), in a meeting with world government representatives, details how the united states government has conspired with the music industry to hide subliminal messages in pop music to brainwash teenagers into buying consumer products. musicians who discover the hidden messages in their music are made to disappear via staged plane crashes, drug overdoses and similar disasters.
the band's first single is released and, due to subliminal messaging, instantly becomes successful. valerie begins to resent the attention the label gives josie, while melody's uncanny behavioral perception makes her suspicious of fiona. fiona orders wyatt to kill valerie and melody before they uncover the conspiracy; they are sent to a fake appearance on total request live where two fake carson dalys attempt to kill them, though they survive due to their incompetence.
wyatt gives josie a copy of the group's latest single, which contains a subliminal message track designed to brainwash her into desiring a solo career. after an argument with her bandmates, josie realizes that the single caused the fight. her suspicions are confirmed when she uses a mixing board to make the subliminal track audible. however, fiona catches her in the act.
megarecords have organized a giant pay-per-view concert that will be streamed online, wherein they plan to unleash a major subliminal message via themed "cat ears" headsets that viewers must buy to hear the audio. fiona and wyatt plan for josie to perform alone, but the band insists on performing together. fiona and wyatt threaten to kill melody and valerie in a staged car explosion if they do not comply, but are thwarted by the badly injured members of dujour, who survived the plane crash by landing the plane in the middle of a metallica concert, where they were severely assaulted by fans.
josie, valerie and melody fight fiona, wyatt and their security guards. during the tussle, fiona accidentally destroys the machine used to generate the messages, revealing the new subliminal message to be one that would make fiona universally popular. fiona reveals that she was a social outcast in high school due to her lisp, while wyatt reveals that his appearance is a disguisehe went to the same high school as fiona, but was a persecuted and unpopular albino. the two immediately fall in love. the government agents colluding with fiona arrive, but with the conspiracy exposed, they arrest fiona and wyatt as scapegoats to cover up their involvement in the scheme. they abandon the idea of using music to spread subliminal messages, revealing that movies are much more effective. (at this point, the message "josie and the pussycats is the best movie ever!" goes by quickly, with "join the army" in smaller lettering beneath it.)
josie, valerie, and melody perform the concert together. alan m arrives and confesses his love for josie, who returns his feelings. the concert audience removes their headsets at josie's suggestion and, able to judge the band on its own merits for the first time, roar their approval.


== cast ==


== production ==
beyonc, aaliyah and lisa "left eye" lopes auditioned for the role of valerie brown. elfont said that they wanted someone who knew how to do comedy, lopes read for the part twice, she really wanted the role, beyonc was "quiet and shy" and aaliyah was "serious and thoughtful".in line with its theme of subliminal advertising, the inordinate degree of product placement in the film constitutes a running gag. almost every scene features a mention or appearance of one or more famous brands, including sega and the dreamcast (sega's mascot sonic the hedgehog also appears in archie comics), motorola, starbucks, gatorade, snapple, evian, target, aquafina, america online, pizza hut, cartoon network (which has aired the cartoon series on many occasions), revlon, kodak, puma, advil, bounce, and more. none of the advertising was paid promotion by the represented brands; it was inserted voluntarily by the filmmakers.cook later expressed surprise at her casting: "somehow, they gave one of the title roles to me, and i cannot sing at all. i don't play guitar. i have no idea." cook said the producers considered her for the titular lead in josie having remembered cook from her audition for the lead role in can't hardly wait (both films were co-written and directed by kaplan and elfont).
