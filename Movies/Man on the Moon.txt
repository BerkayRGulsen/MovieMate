the documentary jim & andy: the great beyond was released in 2017 and chronicles carrey's performance as kaufman in the film, a performance he maintained during much of the film's production.


== plot ==
andy kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. as the audience begins to believe that kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid "foreign man" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on elvis impersonation. the audience bursts into applause, realizing kaufman had tricked them.
kaufman catches the eye of talent agent george shapiro, who signs him as a client and immediately lands him a network television series, taxi, much to kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named latka gravas. secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit.
invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, tony clifton, whom kaufman wants to guest-star on taxi. clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. but backstage, when he meets shapiro in person, clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually kaufman. clifton is a "villain character" created by kaufman and his creative partner, bob zmuda. once again, the gag is on the audience.
kaufman's profile increases with appearances on saturday night live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. when performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as latka. at one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading the great gatsby aloud from start to finish. kaufman shows up on the taxi set as clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the set. he relates to shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience "short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire."
kaufman decides to become a professional wrestler  but to emphasize the "villain" angle, he will wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself "inter-gender wrestling champion." he becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, lynne margulies, and they begin a romantic relationship. his professional issues are deepened when, during an appearance on abc's live television comedy show fridays, kaufman refuses to speak his lines.
kaufman feuds publicly with jerry lawler, a male professional star wrestler, who challenges him to a "real wrestling match", which kaufman accepts. lawler easily overpowers and appears to seriously injure kaufman. lawler and an injured kaufman (wearing a neck brace) appear on nbc's late night with david letterman, ostensibly to call a truce, but the "feud" is exacerbated and they trade insults. lawler hits kaufman, who then spews a vicious tirade of epithets and throws coffee at lawler. it is later revealed that kaufman and lawler are in fact good friends and had staged the entire feud as an act, but kaufman pays an unexpected price when he is voted off from snl following a vote of audience members, weary and bored of his wrestling antics. shapiro advises kaufman and lawler not to work together again, and later calls kaufman to inform him that taxi has been canceled. shapiro is despondent at the news but kaufman is not bothered.
after a show at a comedy club, kaufman calls together lynne, zmuda, and shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer and may die soon. initially they are not sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be yet another of kaufman's stunts, with zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic prank. with little time to live, kaufman arranges a booking at carnegie hall, his dream venue. the performance is a memorable success, culminating with kaufman inviting the entire audience out for milk and cookies. as his health deteriorates rapidly, a desperate kaufman heads to the philippines to seek a medical miracle through psychic surgery only to find it a hoax, laughing at the irony. he dies soon after. at kaufman's funeral, friends and loved ones sing along to "this friendly world" with a video of kaufman. one year later, in 1985, tony clifton appears at kaufman's tribute at the comedy store's main stage, performing "i will survive". zmuda watches in the audience.

== production ==
man on the moon was shot in los angeles in the winter of 1998. the film's production is notable for carrey's rigid method acting, staying in-character as kaufman both on and off the set for the duration of production. carrey's adherence to the role reached the extent where he would develop unscripted tics and habits that were previously characteristic of kaufman himself. among other examples, courtney love noted how carrey would stuff his clothing with limburger cheese on the set when playing kaufman's tony clifton character in the film, something kaufman had done in his own performances of the character.a documentary, jim & andy: the great beyond, was released in november 2017. using behind-the-scenes footage, the documentary covers the production of man on the moon with a particular focus on carrey's method-acting as kaufman.


== soundtrack ==

the soundtrack for the film was written by rock band r.e.m., whose 1992 song "man on the moon" (originally written in honor of kaufman) gave the film its title. the soundtrack also included the grammy-nominated song "the great beyond", which remains the band's highest-charting single in the united kingdom.


== historical accuracy ==
the film makes a few changes to kaufman's life story. as kaufman (played by carrey) explains in the film's prologue, "all the most important things in my life are changed around and mixed up for dramatic purposes."
the famous carnegie hall "milk and cookies" performance, portrayed in the film as one of his last performances after being diagnosed with cancer, had in fact occurred in 1979, five years before kaufman's death and well before his diagnosis. also, the film is deliberately ambiguous over whether kaufman actually died or if his death was a hoax as some fans believe.the film implies that carol kane was a member of the taxi cast during the show's first season, which in real life was 197879. in actuality, kane did not make her first appearance on the series until the episode "guess who's coming for brefnish", which first aired on abc in january 1980 during the show's second season. the film implies that taxi was canceled only once. however, the show went on for one more season on nbc.
other inaccuracies include scenes supposedly drawn from snl, specifically the first episode's host, who is depicted as having been richard belzer but was george carlin in real life. also, the scene where lorne michaels asks the home viewing audience to vote kaufman off the show happened in 1982, two years after michaels left the show as executive producer and dick ebersol took over.after its release, the film attracted some criticism over various events in kaufman's life that were left out. max allan collins maintained that the filmmakers did not understand kaufman, and that the film "does not give kaufman the credit for his genius, that he had a complete intellectual grasp of what he was up to and a showman's instincts for how to play an audience." significantly, these critics included kaufman's own father stanley, who was displeased that little of andy's early life (before show business) and early career were portrayed.sam simon, executive producer on taxi, stated in a 2013 interview with marc maron for the wtf with marc maron podcast that the portrayal of andy on the show was "a complete fiction," that kaufman was "completely professional" and that he "told you tony clifton was him." simon also stated that sources for these stories were mostly from bob zmuda and a "little bit of press and hype," but conceded that kaufman would have "loved" zmuda's version of events.


== reception ==
on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 63% based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. the site's critical consensus reads, "jim carrey is eerily dead-on in his portrayal of andy kaufman, which helps to elevate man on the moon above the script's formulaic biopic cliches." metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 58 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "b" on an a+ to f scale.
roger ebert, giving the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, wrote for the chicago sun times: what is most wonderful about 'man on the moon,' a very good film, is that it remains true to kaufman's stubborn vision. oh, it brightens things up a little [...] but essentially it stays true to his persona: a guy who would test you, fool you, lie to you, deceive you and stage elaborate deceptions, put-ons and hoaxes.
man on the moon ended a string of jim carrey films that had very successful opening weekends, and grossed just $47 million against a budget of $82 million. although the film received mixed reviews from critics, they were near unanimous in their praise for jim carrey's portrayal of andy kaufman. carrey won a golden globe for his performance, and the film was nominated for best musical or comedy as well.
