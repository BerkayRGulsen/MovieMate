== production ==
it was the third film jack smight directed for warners. smight called the script "terrific... a little hard to believe, but nevertheless a jolly fun premise laced with great humor."he says producer elliot kastner cast sandra dee as the female lead mostly because warren beatty wanted to sleep with her. smight said, "though i had worked with sandra in my first film...and had regard for her, i couldnt conceive of her playing a role of the british girl that the script called for...so much for the producers wanting to protect the integrity of a fine screenplay."during preproduction in france, kastner admitted he did not want dee in the film. smight asked jack warner if he could have susannah york and warner agreed; dee was paid off.smight says beatty was undisciplined during filming. they would rehearse scenes but then "just as we were about to roll the camera, warren would ask if he could try something different from what we had earlier settled upon. i wanted to be flexible in the event that what he wanted to do was better than what we had planned. inevitably it wasnt.
