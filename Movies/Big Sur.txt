jack kerouac, coming off the recent success of on the road, is unable to cope with a suddenly demanding public and his rise in popularity, and begins battling with advanced alcoholism as a result. he seeks respite first in solitude in the big sur cabin, then in a relationship with billie, the mistress of his long-time friend neal cassady. kerouac finds respite in the big sur wilderness, but is driven by loneliness to return to the city, and resumes drinking heavily.
across kerouac's subsequent trips to big sur and interleaved lifestyle in san francisco, he drunkenly embarrasses cassady by introducing billie to cassady's wife carolyn, cannot emotionally provide for the increasingly demanding billie, and finds himself increasingly unable to integrate into suburban life. kerouac's inner turmoil culminates in his nervous breakdown during his third journey to big sur.
