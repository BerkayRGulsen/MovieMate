in late 1969, mary rose foster is a famous rock and roll diva known as "the rose." in spite of her success, her personal life is lonely and exhausting. she is exploited and overworked by her gruff, greedy manager and promoter rudge campbell. though forthright and brassy, rose is an insecure alcoholic and former drug user who seems to crave approval in her life. as such, she is determined to return to her florida hometown, now as a superstar, and perform for the people from her past.
after a performance in texas, rose has the opportunity to meet country music star billy ray, whom she idolizes and whose songs she often covers in live shows. billy ray cruelly demands that she never perform his music again, and rudely dismisses her. after discovering that rudge arranged the meeting because he wants to sign billy ray to his label, rose defiantly flees with a limousine driver named huston dyer. the two take a cross-country trip to new york city, where rose is scheduled to complete recording sessions, and begin a whirlwind romance.
rudge assumes that huston is just another hanger-on, but rose feels she has finally met her true love. huston eventually admits to her that he is actually an awol sergeant from the army, and she tells him of her past in florida. the couple's relationship grows turbulent amidst rose's reckless lifestyle and constant touring. in memphis, rose is met by sarah, a former lover of hers. when huston walks in on the two women kissing, he and rose get into a violent fight, after which huston flees.
determined to reunite with huston, rose searches for him in a red light district of memphis with pfc mal, a military member whom she met in texas. she subsequently appoints mal as her security escort, and the two travel to rose's hometown of jacksonville, where rudge has booked her a hometown reunion show. upon arriving, rose shows mal her childhood home, her high school, and other local landmarks from her childhood. arriving at the stadium for afternoon rehearsals for her concert, rose repeats her intention to take a one-year break from performing, leading rudge to tell her she will be in breach of contract. rudge proceeds to fire her, though unbeknownst to rose, this is only a ploy to ensure that she performs the show. a distraught rose is met by huston, who has traveled to jacksonville to reunite with her.
believing her concert is cancelled, rose decides to run away and start a new life with huston. that night, she takes huston on a tour of local bars and clubs she used to frequent prior to becoming famous, recklessly drinking and indulging in barbiturates and heroin. at one bar, huston becomes jealous when a male patron harasses rose as she performs, and begins a fight. after, rudge reaches rose on her car phone and convinces her to return for the concert. she acquiesces, and her decision to appease rudge causes huston to give up on the relationship and leave town. later that night, after performing the opening song of her long-awaited homecoming concert, rose collapses onstage and dies of an overdose.
