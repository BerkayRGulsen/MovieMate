johnny belinda is a 1948 american drama film, directed by jean negulesco, based on the 1940 broadway stage hit of the same name by elmer blaney harris. the play was adapted for the screen by writers allen vincent and irma von cube.
the story is based on an actual incident that happened near harris's summer residence in fortune bridge, bay fortune, prince edward island. the title character is based on the real-life lydia dingwell (18521931), of dingwells mills, prince edward island. the film dramatizes the consequences of spreading lies and rumors, and the horror of rape. the latter subject had previously been prohibited by the motion picture production code. johnny belinda is widely considered to be the first hollywood film for which the restriction was relaxed, and as such was controversial at the time of its initial release.

it was filmed on location in fort bragg, california.

dr. richardson's secretary, stella, is attracted to him and tries to get his attention, but the doctor does not reciprocate her feelings. after stella figures out that he is becoming attracted to belinda, she starts to resent both of them.
one of the family's customers, locky mccormick, gets drunk at a dance, leaves the dance, and goes to the farm when belinda is alone and rapes her. this results in her pregnancy, which is diagnosed by another doctor to whom dr. richardson had brought her for audiology testing. belinda gives birth at home to a healthy baby boy, whom she names johnny. the people in town begin to shun the macdonald family and dr. richardson, as they gossip that he must be johnny's father. dr. richardson tells black that he is willing to marry belinda in order to quiet town gossip. black rejects this idea, as he knows that dr. richardson does not truly love belinda, but merely pities her. boycotted by locals, the doctor takes a position in a toronto hospital. he writes belinda suggesting he will return for her and johnny.
locky goes to the macdonald farm under the pretense of purchasing ground barley, but really wants to get a look at baby johnny. when black sees him, he orders locky to leave. locky inadvertently boasts about the infant son, saying, "spittin' image of his father," revealing to black that he is the father of the child. black follows locky and threatens to expose him to the town. they have a fight on a seaside cliff and locky throws black off the cliff into the sea, killing him. town gossip calls it an accident and does not suspect locky. they celebrate his wedding to stella.
belinda and her aunt aggie try to operate the farm but they are struggling to pay the bills and keep the farm running. farmers boycott their flour mill.  the town, at the urging of locky, has a meeting and declares belinda unfit to care for the child and award him to locky and stella. they come to take johnny.  belinda first makes stella realize that she is a smart and competent mother.  she also makes it clear that she will never give up her baby. stella retreats and tells locky that the mother should keep johnny.  locky demands the baby, telling his wife that it is his son. when he goes to retrieve the boy, he pushes belinda aside. before locky can unlock the upstairs door, belinda kills him with a shotgun.  belinda is arrested and goes on trial for murder. at the trial, dr. richardson testifies that she was protecting her property and family. the court dismisses this as the doctor's love for her, and is ready to sentence belinda to execution, but finally stella blurts out that her husband locky had confessed the truth about the rape to her on the day he was killed. belinda is set free, and she, johnny, and dr. richardson leave together.
