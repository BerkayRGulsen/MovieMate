== plot ==
in 1967, a pregnant woman is attacked by a vampire, causing her to go into premature labor. doctors are able to save her baby, but the woman dies of an unknown infection.
thirty years later, the child has become the vampire hunter, blade, who is a human-vampire hybrid that possesses the supernatural abilities of the vampires without any of their weaknesses; except for the requirement to consume human blood. blade raids a los angeles rave club owned by the vampire deacon frost. police take one of the vampires to the hospital, where he kills dr. curtis webb and feeds on hematologist karen jenson and escapes. blade takes karen to a safe house where she is treated by his old friend abraham whistler. whistler explains that he and blade have been waging a secret war against vampires using weapons based on their elemental weaknesses, such as sunlight, silver, and garlic. as karen is now "marked" by the bite of a vampire, both he and blade tell her to leave the city.
meanwhile, at a meeting of the council of pure-blood vampire elders, frost, the leader of a faction of younger vampires, is rebuked for trying to incite war between vampires and humans. as frost and his kind are not natural-born vampires, they are considered socially inferior. in response, frost has one of the elders executed and strips the others of their authority.
returning to her apartment, karen is attacked by police officer krieger, who is a "familiar", a human loyal to vampires. blade subdues krieger and uses information from him to locate an archive that contains pages from the "vampire bible". he comes upon pearl, a morbidly obese vampire and tortures him with a uv light into revealing that deacon wants to command a ritual where he would use 12 pure blood vampires to awaken the "blood god" la magra; and blade's blood is the key. later, at the hideout, blade injects himself with a special serum that suppresses his urge to drink blood. however, the serum is beginning to lose its effectiveness due to overuse. krieger informs frost of what happened, and frost kills krieger.
while experimenting with the anticoagulant edta as a possible replacement, karen discovers that it explodes when combined with vampire blood. she manages to synthesize a vaccine that can cure the infected but learns that it will not work on blade. karen is confident that she can cure blade's bloodthirst but it would take her years of treating it. frost and his men attack the hideout, infect whistler, and abduct karen. when blade returns, he helps whistler commit suicide.
when blade attempts to rescue karen from frost's penthouse, he is shocked to find his still-alive mother, who reveals that she came back the night she was attacked and was brought in by frost, who appears and reveals himself as the vampire who bit her. blade is then subdued and taken to the temple of eternal night, where frost plans to perform the summoning ritual for la magra. karen is thrown into a pit to be devoured by webb, who has transformed into a decomposing zombie-like creature. karen injures webb and escapes. blade is drained of his blood, but karen allows him to drink from her, enabling him to recover. frost completes the ritual and obtains the powers of la magra. blade confronts frost after killing all of his minions, including his mother. during their fight, blade injects frost with all of the syringes, the overdose of edta causes his body to inflate and explode, killing him.
karen offers to help blade cure himself, instead he asks her to create an improved version of the serum, so he can continue his crusade against vampires. in a brief epilogue, blade confronts a vampire in moscow.

== production ==


=== background ===
the character blade was created in 1973 for marvel comics by the writer marv wolfman and artist gene colan as a supporting character in the 1970s comic the tomb of dracula. the comic blade used teakwood knives and was much more the everyman in his behavior and attitude. though courageous and brave, he displayed flaws as well, such as an inability to get along with certain other supporting cast members and hatred of vampires that bordered on fanaticism.
the character was not originally a "daywalker" but a human being immune to being turned into a vampire. lacking the superhuman speed and strength of his undead quarry, he relied solely on his wits and skill until he was bitten by the character morbius as seen in peter parker: spider-man #8, first published in august 1999. the film portrayal of blade was updated for a 1990s audience and the comics character was subsequently modified to match. the film's version of deacon frost also differs greatly from his comic counterpart. although the film retains frost's upstart ambitions, he was a great deal younger and more updated for the 1990s.


=== development ===
marvel studios had developed the film as early as 1992, when rapper/actor ll cool j was interested in playing the lead role. blade was eventually set up at new line cinema, with david s. goyer writing the script. according to goyer, new line originally wanted to do blade as "something that was almost a spoof" before the writer convinced them otherwise. at one point, the studio even asked if blade could be white. after failing to get a black panther film into production, in 1996 wesley snipes signed on to star as blade.


=== casting ===
when goyer first pitched the idea of doing a blade film, the executives of new line felt there were only three actors who could possibly do the role: snipes, denzel washington, and laurence fishburne, but to goyer, snipes was always the perfect choice for blade.
patrick mcgoohan was the first choice to play whistler, as stephen norrington was a fan of the prisoner (1967). jon voight was also considered for the role.jet li was offered the role of deacon frost but opted to do lethal weapon 4 instead. mark wahlberg was also considered for the role of frost. skeet ulrich lobbied for the role of frost.


=== filming ===
blade was produced on a budget of $45 million and principal photography commenced on february 5, 1997, in large part done in los angeles, with some scenes being shot in death valley. all sets were constructed, and all on-set filming occurred, in what was formerly the redken shampoo factory in canoga park. the effects for the film were done by flat earth productions.


=== post-production ===
the first cut of the film was 140 minutes long. it had a disastrous test screening with audiences. heavy edits and re-shoots were implemented which delayed the release date for more than half a year. the most significant change was the addition of the final sword fight between blade and deacon frost, which did not exist in the original cut. in the original ending, frost turned into la magra and became a large swirling mass of blood instead of keeping his form. this was scrapped because the filmmakers could not get the special effects to look right. it can be seen as a special feature on the dvd. stan lee originally had a cameo that was ultimately cut from the film. he played one of the cops that came into the blood club during the aftermath and discover quinn's body on fire. the scene where karen and deacon are talking about the cure for vampirism initially ran slightly longer and answered the question of how the vampires would feed if everybody was turned into a vampire. they would keep some humans alive in giant blood bags to harvest them. the bags can still be seen in a doorway during the scene, and later played an integral part of the plot in blade: trinity.


== music ==

a soundtrack containing hip hop music was released on august 25, 1998, by tvt records and epic records. it peaked at #36 on the billboard 200 and #28 on the top r&b/hip-hop albums. the british techno band the prodigy was approached to do the soundtrack and score to the film but had to turn down the offer due to other commitments.

=== lawsuit ===
marv wolfman unsuccessfully sued marvel, new line, and time warner for $35 million after the release of the film, claiming he was not bound by a work for hire contract when he created the character in 1972. he, along with artist gene colan, received a "based on characters created by" credit in this film, but did not receive a credit in blade ii or the tv series.

=== critical response ===
on rotten tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 56% based on 104 reviews, with an average rating of 5.92/10. the site's consensus states: "though some may find the plot a bit lacking, blade's action is fierce, plentiful, and appropriately stylish for a comic book adaptation." on metacritic, the film has a score of 45%, based on reviews from 23 critics. audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "a-" on an a+ to f scale.roger ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, writing: "blade ... is a movie that relishes high visual style. it uses the extreme camera angles, the bizarre costumes and sets, the exaggerated shadows, the confident cutting between long shots and extreme closeups. it slams ahead in pure visceral imagery."  james berardinelli gave the film 2 stars out of 4, writing: "blade has the capacity to dazzle, but it also will leave many viewers dissatisfied." berardinelli also wrote: "blade opens brilliantly, with a series of fast-paced, visually-engaging scenes that display the seedy underbelly of vampire society and introduce the implacable title character in true superhero fashion. for about its first hour, the movie offers violent, visceral, rapid fire entertainment that concentrates as much on developing a distinctive atmosphere as on advancing a minimalist storyline. unfortunately [...] it keeps going and going, eventually wearing out its welcome."
john krewson of the a.v. club was critical of the story and the dialogue, but praised the "creative cinematography and non-stop, decently choreographed gratuitous violence".critics such as a. asbjrn jn have noted not only the important place of blade in the wider vampire genre but also possible intertextual links between the whistler character and a character named whistler in a dozen black roses (1996) by nancy a. collins, as they possess "striking similarities in role, dramatic focus, visual appearance, and sharing the name".


== video game ==

a video game based on the film was published and released by activision in 2000. the game received mixed reviews. on metacritic it received a weighted average score 51% based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". a separate game for the game boy color was also released.
