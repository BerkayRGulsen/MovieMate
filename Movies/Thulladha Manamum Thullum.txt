=== development ===
the film saw director ezhil, an erstwhile assistant to robert-rajashekhar, panneer and parthiban, make his debut as a film-maker under r. b. choudary's production house. the film's concept was inspired from charlie chaplin star city lights that ezhil had watched during a film festival. an earlier version of the script showed vijay's character as a painter. the initial title for the film was "rukmanikkaga but producer rb chaudhary later changed it to thullatha manamum thullum.


=== casting ===
initially, ezhil wanted comedian vadivelu to play the lead role. vadivelu, who was impressed with the story, has said to ezhil that the storyline was too good and he doesn't know whether it will work with him in the lead. vadivelu asked ezhil to wait for six months, and if he didn't find anyone else by then, he would take the role. vadivelu was then replaced by vijay. murali was also considered for the lead role before vijay was selected. on the suggestion of his friends, ezhil decided to make the film with a commercial hero and changed the entire script retaining only the emotional core of city lights.  prior to release, the role of vijay's mother in the film was kept under wraps with the media speculating who would play the role. eventually, no actress played the role although the character played a pivotal part in the film. vijay took a pay cut for the film, accepting only 30 lakh  instead of 50 lakh, as he had signed the film before the release of his film kadhalukku mariyadhai. rambha was initially supposed to do the project, but as the project underwent changes, the actress opted out before she was replaced by simran.


=== filming ===
the film's shoot began with the "dhuddu" song as the director felt it would give the team some time to gel. this was the first vijay song which raju sundaram choreographed. the story takes place in triplicane because ezhil had lived there for a while in his uncle's house. the team scouted for a long time to find a suitable location that fit the story's requirements however a chance visit to the set of a malayalam film at murugalaya studios convinced ezhil that erecting a set would be far more cost-effective and thus set resembling triplicane was erected.


== soundtrack ==
the soundtrack of the film was composed by s. a. rajkumar, while lyrics were written by vairamuthu and muthu vijayan. rajkumar agreed to compose the music for this film after coming to know that ezhil had assisted robert-rajasekaran, the duo who introduced him in films.the song "meghamaai vandhu" which was supposed to be the theme song of the film, was inspired from punjabi song "sayonee" sang by the band junoon in 1997 in pakistan; ezhil wanted tamil version of it. after the song was recorded, he came to know that deva had used the same tune for "salomiya" from kannedhirey thondrinal. sa rajkumar told him not to worry and gave him the tune of "innisai paadi varum".


== release ==
the film released on 29 january 1999 and ran for over 200 days in theatres across tamil nadu. the satellite rights of the film were secured by sun tv. the film was given a "u" certificate by the indian censor board.
