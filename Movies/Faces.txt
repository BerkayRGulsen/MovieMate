== versions ==
as is the case with several of cassavetes' films, several different versions of faces are known to exist (though it was generally assumed that, after creating the general release print, cassavetes destroyed the alternative versions). it was initially premiered in toronto with a running time of 183 minutes, before cassavetes cut it down to 130 minutes. though the 130-minute version is the general release version, a print of a longer version with a running time of 147 minutes was accidentally found by ray carney, and was deposited at the library of congress. 17 minutes of this print were included in the criterion box set john cassavetes: five films, though carney has said that there are numerous differences between the two films.


== reception ==
faces holds an 83% approval rating on review aggregation website rotten tomatoes, based on 24 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. roger ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars and wrote that the film "tenderly, honestly, and uncompromisingly examines the way we really live".pauline kael, however, was negative to this film, criticizing the "badly performed" acting and "crudely conceived" scenes. in 2011, faces was selected for preservation in the united states national film registry by the library of congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". the registry called the film "an example of cinematic excess" whose extended confrontations revealed "emotions and relations of power between men and women that rarely emerge in more conventionally structured films".
faces, and other cassavetes projects, had significant creative impact on martin scorsese, woody allen, and robert altman.
