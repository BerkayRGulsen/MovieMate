"daddy's home" is a famous song by american doo-wop group shep and the limelites. the song was written by the three members of the band, james "shep" sheppard (19351970), clarence bassett (19362005) and charles baskerville. the group recorded the original version of "daddy's home" on february 1, 1961, and it was released on hull records in march 1961 with the b-side being "this i know".
"daddy's home" reached no. 2 on the billboard popular music chart in may 1961.  it was kept from no.1 by "travelin' man" by ricky nelson.later songs by the band were not as successful as "daddy's home", but still sold well.


== part of a song cycle ==
the song is an example of james sheppard's legacy of composing of rock 'n' roll's first-ever song cycle titles, telling the story of a relationship, beginning with going home to his girl, and further twists along the way, like getting married, celebrating their anniversary, problems encountered etc. the songs that told this story cycle were famously  "a thousand miles away", "500 miles to go", both with the heartbeats; and continued with "daddy's home", "three steps from the altar," "our anniversary", and "what did daddy do?" for shep and the limelites.


== controversy ==
kahl music, publisher of "a thousand miles away", an earlier song written by sheppard, sued keel music, publisher of "daddy's home", for copyright violation. keel eventually lost, and this resulted in the end of the limelites and hull records in 1966 as a fall-off of the controversy.
