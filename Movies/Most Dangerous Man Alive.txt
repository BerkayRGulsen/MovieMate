the film began as a story by leo gordon called the atomic man. gordon went to fellow actor michael pate to rewrite the story. needing money, gordon sold his rights to pate who took the story to his brother-in-law, screenwriter phillip rock.producer benedict bogeaus had wanted to shoot the film as a television pilot (a common creative practice of the time), to be shown on tv as three episodes, should it be picked up for syndication. traveling to mexico to begin shooting in 1960, mexican film syndicates ruled that it was actually a feature film and demanded bogeaus make it using a full crew, which would now have to be paid at feature film labor rates. with the budget now tripled, director allen dwan claimed he had to shoot the feature in one week, instead of five (some members of the cast disputed this statement).it was randell's last leading role.
