== career ==
alonso's first gold album and number one song on the charts was love maniac, released in 1979 under the name  mbar. after that followed her second number one with "the witch" and soon after "dangerous rhythm". for what is considered her best known song, she was asked by giorgio moroder to write the lyrics in spanish and sing "vamos a bailar" which he had written for the soundtrack of the film scarface. the song instantly became a classic amongst spanish speakers despite failing to garner major attention outside of cuba where it was recorded. her two albums with mbar and her solo debut were recorded in english. it was her second album mara conchita from 1984 that made her an international singing star in the spanish-speaking market, receiving her first out of three grammy award nominations (1985, 1988, 1994).alonso made her hollywood film debut in moscow on the hudson (1984) with robin williams, and also starred in movies like touch and go (1986) extreme prejudice (1987), the running man (1987), colors (1988), vampire's kiss (1989), predator 2 (1990) and the house of the spirits (1993).
she was the first latin-born actresses to star in a broadway show in 1995, playing aurora in kiss of the spider woman. she later acted in romantic comedies like chasing papi (2003) and the last guy on earth (2006).
alonso was cast to play luca, the mother of gabrielle solis, on the abc series desperate housewives. the episode was aired on february 19, 2006. she was in the latin version amas de casa desesperadas for univision network. she was a guest star in the live-action film of the comic book el muerto and appeared in the film material girls (2006).

== political views ==
alonso has often spoken in support of lgbt rights and in appreciation to her lgbt fans, stating that "i was very much supported by the community when i first came out with my music". in a 2004 article, she compared herself to cher in terms of her connection to lgbt culture.alonso was an outspoken critic of cuba's fidel castro and venezuelan president hugo chvez, whom she described as a "dictator"-like "hitler" and whose voters and supporters she described as "terrorists." she appeared on sean hannity's hannity's america on may 6, 2007, hannity & colmes on june 1, 2007 and bill o'reilly's the o'reilly factor on august 13, 2007 and march 11, 2009.
alonso issued an "open letter to sean penn" online on march 29, 2010 regarding his support of hugo chvez. she used a point-by-point refrain of "why" in her letter questioning various issues occurring in venezuela. in december 2011, she got into a heated exchange with penn at a los angeles airport during which penn called her a pig and she responded by calling penn a communist (both played lovers in the 1988 movie colors).in the fall of 2008, alonso endorsed the presidential campaign of republican nominee john mccain, writing:
as a latina and a new american citizen, i believe in this country and its people, and i believe that we need more than just "change." we need a leader who can bring about the right kind of change, and john mccain has the experience and judgment necessary to lead us in these uncertain times. i grew up in cuba and venezuela, and i am appalled that barack obama apparently wants to emulate the "spread the wealth" economic policies of those countries and negotiate with their leaders.
in an august 2012 spreecast interview, alonso stated her opposition to obama's re-election, saying that if reelected he would take steps to make the united states become more like venezuela under the chvez government.in january 2014, alonso resigned from a san francisco production of the vagina monologues after appearing in an advertisement for republican candidate for governor tim donnelly.on september 17, 2014, venezuelan president nicols maduro asked interior minister miguel rodrguez torres to pursue legal actions to revoke alonso's venezuelan citizenship. the reason was her public request on a radio interview for a military intervention against venezuela: "in my opinion, (the us) must intervene, because the cubans already invaded without firing a single bullet because they gave it (venezuela) for free. so i would like that the us would invade using bullets to get all those communists out of venezuela".in mid-2016, alonso stated that she supported neither republican presidential candidate donald trump nor democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton in the u.s. election, viewing both of them as unacceptable. she ended up supporting gary johnson in the general election.
in 2020, alonso agreed with president donald trump about election fraud, fraudulent voting machines, and covid-19 cases in many of her tweets. "guys. please. think. there r more #covid19 cases cause there r more testings. is it hard to understand?", she tweeted on november 2, 2020.
