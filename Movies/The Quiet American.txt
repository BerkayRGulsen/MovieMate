the quiet american is a 2002 film adaptation of graham greene's bestselling 1955 novel set in vietnam, the quiet american. it was directed by phillip noyce and starred michael caine, brendan fraser, and do thi hai yen.
the 2002 version of the quiet american, in contrast to the 1958 film version, depicted greene's original ending and treatment of the principal american character, pyle. like the novel, the film illustrates pyle's moral culpability in arranging terrorist actions aimed at the french colonial government and the viet minh. going beyond greene's original work, the film used a montage ending with superimposed images of american soldiers from the intervening decades of the vietnam war.
miramax paid $5.5 million for the rights to distribute the film in north america and some other territories, but it shelved the film for a year due to the september 11 attacks and the film's "unpatriotic" message. the film finally received an oscar qualification release in november 2002 and went on to gross us$12.9 million in limited theatrical release in the united states. the film received positive reviews from critics and michael caine was nominated for the academy award for best actor.


== plot ==
the story is set in 1952 in saigon, vietnam (french indochina at that time), toward the end of the first indochina war (19461954) in which french forces fought the communist-led viet minh rebels. on one level, the quiet american is a love story about the triangle that develops between thomas fowler, a british journalist in his fifties; a young american idealist, supposedly an aid worker, named alden pyle; and phuong, a vietnamese woman. on another level it is also about the growing american involvement that led to the full-scale american war in vietnam.
thomas fowler (michael caine), who narrates the story, is involved in the war only as a reporter, an unengaged observer, apart from one crucial event. pyle (brendan fraser), who represents america and its policies in vietnam, is a cia operative sent to steer the war according to americas interests, and is passionately devoted to the ideas of york harding, an american foreign policy theorist who said that what vietnam needed was a "third force" to take the place of both the colonialists and the vietnamese rebels and restore order. pyle sets about creating a "third force" against the french and the viet minh by using a vietnamese splinter group headed by corrupt militia leader general th (based on the actual trinh minh the). his arming of th's militia with american weaponry leads to a series of terrorist bombings in saigon. these bombings, dishonestly blamed on the communists in order to further american outrage, kill a number of innocent people, including women and children.
meanwhile, pyle has taken fowler's vietnamese mistress phuong (do thi hai yen), promising her marriage and security.  when fowler finds out about pyle's involvement in the bombings, he takes one definitive action to seal all of their fates. he indirectly agrees to let his assistant, hinh (tzi ma), and hinh's communist cohorts confront pyle; when pyle tries to flee, hinh fatally stabs him. phuong subsequently returns to fowler, and while the local french police commander (rade erbedija) suspects fowler's role in pyle's murder, he has no evidence and does not pursue the matter.
