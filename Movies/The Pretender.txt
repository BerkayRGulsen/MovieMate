== critical reception ==
critic dennis schwartz liked the film and wrote, "billy wilder's lesser known elder brother william lee wilder...directs this striking film noir about a successful man becoming paranoiac and placing himself in entrapment. in one amazing characteristic noir scene, the protagonist is seated on the floor of his unlit, locked room eating crackers and canned food, afraid of being poisoned. this is one of the first movies to score for theremin, an effectively chilling mood music which later became a clich for many 1950s sci-fi films about aliens. john alton's dark film noir photography sets the proper mood for the melodrama. the film noir is absorbing despite stilted dialogue and flat direction."
