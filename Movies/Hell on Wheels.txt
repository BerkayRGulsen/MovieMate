== production ==
the film was shot in nashville and was independently produced. john ashley later recalled: "marty was a terrific fellow and a great singer, and i was a big fan of his. he was a stock car racer, loved stock cars, and the producers had put this thing together. they said to me that this was going to be his motion picture debut, and they needed me to play his brother and basically carry the movie. so i went down there for six or seven weeks."ashley, a native of oklahoma, says that he was "... a big country and western fan. i got a chance to meet a lot of the guys i had heard and admired." ashley met charley pride on the night that pride became the first black artist to appear at the grand ole opry. ashley later helped robbins sponsor a stock car racer. "i didn't have to commit a lot of money, but he wanted a publicity tie-in with me, putting straightaway on the car. marty never drove my car, but my car did compete in a couple of races marty was in." although ashley had a career as a pop singer, he did not sing in the film.
