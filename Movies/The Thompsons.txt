== reception ==
beyond hollywood wrote, "the thompsons is very much a pleasant surprise, an entertaining and reasonably well crafted modern vampire tale. though a little bit true blood, the film is considerably more engaging than most others of its type, boosted by a likeable returning cast. the films real strengths are its surprisingly human script (written by the butcher brothers and knauf) and solid character work, both of which help to keep the viewer involved".
