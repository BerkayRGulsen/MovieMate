note: measuring the number of deaths caused by a heat wave requires complicated statistical analysis, since heat waves tend to cause large numbers of deaths among people weakened by other conditions. as a result, the number of deaths is only known with any accuracy for heat waves in the modern era in countries with developed healthcare systems.

death counts are historical totals unless indicated otherwise.
events in boldface are ongoing.
