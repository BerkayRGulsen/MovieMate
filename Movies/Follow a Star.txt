== plot ==
norman truscott works as a dry cleaner, but dreams of being a stage performer. to this end, he takes elocution and singing lessons with miss dobson, so far with little success. he is also in love with judy, miss dobson's colleague, who teaches piano.
norman goes to the theatre to see singing star vernon carew and causes chaos when he tries to join in the performance. but carew realises that norman's untrained voice is better that his own voice, which is fading rapidly, as is his popularity. on the pretext of offering norman singing lessons, he secretly records norman singing in the bath, and passes the recordings off as his own - miming to the recording on television. they are a success and carew is a star again.
miss dobson realises what's happened and smuggles herself and norman backstage during carew's performance. she sees the record being played with carew miming to it. she exposes him as a fake, again causing chaos onstage and backstage. norman is persuaded to sing on stage and is acclaimed by the audience. but whilst they applaud him, he slips quietly away with judy.
