== plot ==
may (played by anne reid) is a woman from northern england. her life has been constrained by the expectations of society and her husband.  when her husband dies during a visit to their adult children in london, she has a chance to start over and pursue her love of drawing.
although her husband's death initially prods may toward the stereotypical silence, irrelevance, and invisibility expected of grandmothers and widows, may finds the courage to reinvent herself.  she initiates a sexual affair with darren (daniel craig), a warm and attractive younger man who is renovating her son's house and who is her daughter's lover. darren shares may's interest in art and the unlikely pair form a genuine friendship in the midst of their "may-december romance."  however, when may's children stumble upon a sketchbook filled with may's drawings of darren in compromising positions, her son and daughter are unable to comprehend the connection that may and darren have formed.  tensions erupt.  darren's own personal difficulties and drug use further complicate the situation, as does a sexual assault committed by bruce, an older man who may's daughter had encouraged her to date.  may returns home, but only long enough to grab her passport.  she walks away with her suitcase, sketchbooks and passport in hand, seeking to live before she dies.
