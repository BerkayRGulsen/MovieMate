== plot ==
in 1940, during the battle of france, allied soldiers have retreated to dunkirk. tommy, a young british private, is the sole survivor of a german ambush. at the beach, he finds thousands of troops awaiting evacuation and meets gibson, who is burying a body. after a luftwaffe dive bomber attack, they attempt to get aboard a hospital ship, but are ordered off. the ship is sunk by dive bombers; tommy saves another soldier, alex. they get aboard a destroyer, only to have it torpedoed and sunk before it can depart.
with a single, vulnerable mole available for embarking on deep-draft ships, the royal navy requisitions civilian vessels in great britain that can get to the beach. in weymouth, a civilian sailor dawson, with his son peter, sets out on his boat moonstone, rather than let the navy commandeer her. their teenage hand george impulsively joins them. at sea, they rescue a shivering shell-shocked soldier from a wrecked ship. when he realises that dawson is sailing for dunkirk, the soldier demands that they turn back and tries to wrest control of the boat; in the scuffle, george suffers a head injury that renders him blind. elsewhere, three spitfires, tasked with defending the evacuation, cross the english channel. after their leader is shot down in a dogfight, one of the pilots, farrier, assumes command, but the other spitfire is hit and ditches. its pilot, collins, is rescued by moonstone.
tommy, alex and gibson join some soldiers of a highlanders regiment and hide inside a beached trawler in the intertidal zone outside the allied perimeter, waiting for the rising tide to refloat it. during the wait, german troops start shooting at the boat for target practice, and water enters through the bullet holes. alex, hoping to lighten the boat, accuses gibson, who has stayed silent, of being a german spy. gibson reveals he is french; he stole the identity of the dead british soldier he buried, hoping to be evacuated with the british. the group abandons the boat when it begins to sink, but gibson is entangled in a chain and drowns. when a nearby minesweeper is sunk by a bomber, moonstone manoeuvres to take on those in the water, including tommy and alex. peter discovers that george is dead. asked by the shell-shocked soldier, he lies and says that george will be fine.
farrier reaches dunkirk just as his fuel runs out. gliding over the beach, he shoots down a dive-bomber, saving ships and troops, and lands beyond the perimeter. he sets fire to his plane before being taken prisoner by the germans. in all, over 300,000 men are evacuated. royal navy commander bolton stays to oversee the evacuation of the french. arriving back in weymouth, the shell-shocked soldier sees george's body being carried away. tommy and alex board a train, and receive a hero's welcome when the train arrives in woking. tommy reads churchills address to the house of commons citing the miracle of deliverance in dunkirk.

=== development ===

director christopher nolan conceived the film in the mid-1990s, when he and his future wife emma thomas sailed across the english channel, following the path of many small boats in the dunkirk evacuation. nolan considered improvising the entire film instead of writing a script, but thomas convinced him otherwise. in 2015, nolan wrote a 76-page screenplay, which was about half the length of his usual scripts and his shortest to date. its precise structure necessitated fictional characters, rather than ones based on eyewitnesses.the story is told from three perspectivesland (one week of action), sea (one day of action), and air (one hour of action). nolan structured the film from the point of view of the characters, intending to use visuals rather than dialogue and backstory. he wanted to incorporate the so-called "snowball effect" that he had previously used only in the third acts of his other films. nolan said that he approached research as though it were for a documentary, and was attracted to the project because of its inversion of the "hollywood formula": the battle of dunkirk was not a victory and did not involve american armed forces, but nevertheless demanded a large-scale production.nolan postponed dunkirk until he had acquired sufficient experience directing large-scale action films. to convey the perspective of soldiers on the beach, for whom contact with the enemy was "extremely limited and intermittent", he did not show germans on screen. he omitted scenes with winston churchill and the generals in war rooms, as he did not want to get "bogged down in the politics of the situation". nolan showed key members of the crew eleven films that had inspired him: all quiet on the western front (1930), the wages of fear (1953), alien (1979), speed (1994), unstoppable (2010), greed (1924), sunrise (1927), ryan's daughter (1970), the battle of algiers (1966), chariots of fire (1981), and foreign correspondent (1940)only two of which are war films. the historical consultant was author joshua levine, who also wrote the book adaptation, dunkirk: the history behind the major motion picture. levine accompanied nolan while interviewing veterans. during these interviews, nolan was told a story of soldiers seen walking into the sea in desperation, which he incorporated into the screenplay.the production team and scouting locations were chosen before nolan and thomas solicited warner bros. pictures to make the film. nolan and his production designer nathan crowley toured the beach of dunkirk while location scouting, and decided to film there despite the logistical challenges, discarding suffolk as an alternative. crowley set up a makeshift art department in nolan's old garage, as is tradition, and colourised black-and-white photographs to better understand the visual representation. the design aesthetic was made to look as contemporary as possible. hoyte van hoytema, who had previously collaborated with nolan on interstellar, was chosen as the director of photography. the hollywood reporter stated that nolan made a deal with warner bros. to receive a $20 million salary plus 20% of the box office gross; however, vanity fair reported that nolan agreed to a low upfront salary in exchange for a large backend percentage.pre-production began in january 2016. for the uniforms, costume designer jeffrey kurland aimed to balance historical accuracy with aesthetics that would favour the film stock. as the original heavy wool fabric had not been produced since 1940, it was made from scratch, tailored for the main cast and over a thousand extras. uniforms were made in a factory in pakistan and the boots by a shoemaker in mexico. the costume department then spent three weeks ageing them at longcross studios. each garment was made to look distinct in regiment and personality: tommy wears a large greatcoat, while alex dons the highlander cut. kurland found references at museums, in contemporary magazines, photo archives, and books. the mole was rebuilt over four months from the original blueprints. sand was brought from dunkirk to create make-up consistent with the environment. oil and tar were specially made and prosthetics were water and fire resistant.


=== casting ===
after first-hand accounts of the evacuation revealed how young and inexperienced the soldiers had been, nolan decided to cast young and unknown actors for the beach setting. he was also adamant that all of the cast be british. john papsidera and toby whale were the casting directors for dunkirk. tom hardy, kenneth branagh, and mark rylance were in talks to join the ensemble as supporting characters in late 2015. fionn whitehead was cast as the lead in march 2016, while jack lowden, aneurin barnard, and harry styles were added shortly after. cillian murphy joined the following month. james d'arcy, barry keoghan, and tom glynn-carney were included later that may.michael caine was cast in a spoken cameo role as fortis leader, as a nod to his role in the film battle of britain (1969). according to d'arcy and nolan, winnant and bolton act as a greek chorus to give the audience context. whitehead went through a secretive auditioning process lasting several months. his character was named after the slang term for the ordinary british soldier. styles was cast for his "old fashioned face", as stated by nolan. he won the role after auditioning against hundreds of candidates, when nolan was unaware of his renown as a singer. murphy spoke to nolan and read about the psychological trauma the soldiers endured, to understand his character's ptsd. nolan chose rylance for his work in the theatre and performance in wolf hall. as research, rylance piloted his character's boat every day, listened to audio recordings at the imperial war museum, and read accounts of men like mr dawson. between takes, he encouraged rehearsal through improvised scenes. the principal cast members did their own stunts. john nolan, uncle of christopher, played blind man.


=== filming ===

principal photography commenced on 23 may 2016 in dunkirk, planned so as to avoid bastille day and coincide with the dates of the real evacuation. production continued for four weeks in urk, netherlands, one week in swanage and weymouth in dorset, united kingdom, and for two weeks at the point vicente interpretive center and lighthouse in rancho palos verdes, california, united states.

filming in dunkirk took place at the location of the real evacuation, while the street scenes were shot in nearby malo-les-bains because most of the buildings in dunkirk were destroyed in the war. shooting times on the beach and mole were determined by tidal patterns. french labour strikes and regulations also affected the schedule.to minimise the need for computer-generated imagery (cgi), cardboard cut-out props of soldiers and military vehicles created the illusion of a large army. real or scale-model fighter aircraft, and real warships and private boats, provided realism that could not be achieved from cgi. scale models were created via 3d printing. the mole set was frequently rebuilt after being damaged by bad weather. because french authorities had prohibited pyrotechnic charges to protect marine life, air cannons were used instead. six thousand extras were needed in france.early scenes of the film were shot at weymouth harbour, and the final scenes at swanage railway station. universal pictures' falls lake studio in los angeles was used for interior and exterior sets of a sinking ship and plane, with the ship interiors filmed in a water tank using stuntmen. to get acclimatised to cold water scenes, styles and whitehead underwent training sessions at point dume.

crowley and marine coordinator neil andrea located nearly sixty ships, which nolan had reconditioned for the shoot. these included the retired french navy destroyer maill-brz, which was made to look like a 1940 british warship as there were no wartime british destroyers left with working engines. three retired royal netherlands navy ships were also used: the minesweeper hnlms naaldwijk portrayed hms britomart, hnlms sittard portrayed hms havant and hms jaguar, and mlv castor (a royal netherlands navy armed pilot vessel) portrayed hms basilisk. the motor torpedo boat mtb 102 and the 1930s norwegian steamer rogaland were also used. over fifty other boats included twenty actual little ships of dunkirk, piloted by their owners. a small 1930s motor yacht called moonstone served for six weeks of filming; its most demanding scenes, with up to sixty people on a boat designed for fewer than ten, were shot on the dutch lake ijsselmeer to avoid the challenge of the dunkirk tides.

aircraft were equipped with dual cockpits for filming in flight. a yakovlev yak-52tw was modified to resemble a supermarine spitfire, and two supermarine spitfire mark ias, a spitfire mark vb, and a hispano buchon painted to look like a messerschmitt bf 109e, were also used for the combat scenes. large-scale radio controlled model aircraft, including heinkel he 111 and junkers ju 87 bombers, were filmed crashing into the english channel. the real spitfires were provided by the imperial war museum duxford, and owner dan friedkin piloted the one that was shot landing on the beach in dunkirk. these takes had to be done within forty-five minutes, before the tide came back in. imax cameras were attached to the fighter planes using specially made snorkel and periscope lensesin the back and the frontand large-scale mockups were submerged with cable rigs for a crash scene. scroggins aviation and gateguards uk performed period aviation reconstruction. a piper aerostar enabled filming from the air, also with imax cameras front and rear. dogfights over the channel were shot by an aerial unit based at lee-on-solent airfield. hardy and lowden spent the final stages of the shooting schedule on a cliffside in palos verdes, inside purpose-built cockpit gimbals, with limited contact with the rest of the cast and crew. dunkirk wrapped on 2 september 2016, after sixty-eight days.the film was shot in natural lighting using both imax 65 mm and 65 mm large format film stock in panavision system 65, with more imax footage than in any of nolan's previous filmsan estimated seventy-five percent. the sparsity of dialogue made it possible for imax cameras, which are notoriously noisy, to be used as the primary format. panavision and imax lenses enabled filming at night. for the first time in a feature film, imax cameras were used hand-held, which steven spielberg and ron howard advised as the best way to shoot on vessels.


=== post-production ===
nolan's regular collaborator lee smith returned to edit dunkirk, beginning in september 2016 after smith had assembled shots unsupervised while filming was still in progress. editing took place in los angeles with an audio mixing team of eight people. nolan singled out the editing of the aerial sequences as a particular challenge, likening this to a chess game. limited computer-generated imagery was applied to improve some scenes, but none consisted entirely of cgi. weather continuity presented less of a challenge than was expected, with filming both in europe and california. at least ten to fifteen feature-length versions were cut to further refine the dramatic impact. once a cut was completed, only then did they apply music.post-production had fifty-four hours of raw footage to work with. the only usable sounds from production recordings were voiceseverything else was recreated. sound designer richard king sent two sound mixers to audio record the spitfires at the imperial war museum duxford using twenty-four microphones. unable to find an actual dive siren of a stuka dive bomber, king reverse engineered one from old photographs in an attempt to replicate the sound. for scenes in which ships gave out sounds of people in distress, voices were captured using an adr "loop group". c-4 and liquid propane were blown up to record sound for the explosions. also featured were the whistles attributed to german bombs during the second world war. bomb noises were made to increase in pitch the closer they got to impact, to stay true to reality. double negative undertook the visual effects work. fotokem, the film laboratory, also handled the release prints.


== music ==
hans zimmer began working on the score in 2016, continued for eleven months, and eventually created a 100-minute demo. for intensity, the script was written to accommodate the auditory illusion of a shepard tone, which had previously been explored in nolan's 2006 film the prestige. this was coupled with the sound of nolan's own pocket watch, which he recorded and sent to zimmer to be synthesised. additional music was provided by lorne balfe, andrew kawczynski, steve mazzaro, and benjamin wallfisch."nimrod" from edward elgar's enigma variations is part of the theme, which was slowed down to six beats per minute with added bass notes to avoid it sounding sentimental. instrumentation included a double bass and fourteen cellos played in high register. king relayed to zimmer the sound of a boat engine, which served as a reference for the tempo. zimmer visited the dunkirk set for inspiration, taking back a jar of sand, and chose not to view raw footage whilst composing. the music was recorded at air lyndhurst hall with mix engineer geoff foster.


== release ==
the world premiere was on 13 july 2017 at odeon leicester square in london. the film was theatrically released on 21 july, projected on imax, 70 mm and 35 mm film. it is the fourth nolan film to be released in the third week of july, a period in which warner bros. pictures has previously achieved success. it was nolan's preference that the film opened in july instead of the northern-hemisphere autumn awards season. the film was initially screened in 125 theatres in 70 mm, the widest release in that format in twenty-five years.dunkirk received a special imax screening at the 2017 toronto international film festival, the first nolan film to appear at the festival since following, nineteen years earlier. after its original release of 126 days, the film was re-released in fifty imax and 70 mm theatres on 1 december, expanding to 250 additional cities in january 2018.

== historical accuracy ==
the film was noted for its generally realistic representation of the historical evacuation. it accurately depicts a few royal air force planes dogfighting the luftwaffe over the sea, limited to one hour of operation by their fuel capacity. the combat however is portrayed at much lower altitude than the reality. in 1940, destroyers and fighter planes were indeed held back from battle, as the royal navy and air force would have been the sole defenders against invasion. there was indeed a temporary withdrawal of destroyers during the early stages after considerable losses however an appeal to the admiralty by admiral ramsay reversed that decision. also noted were the accurate depictions of how a small boat attempted to evade aerial attack, and of how soldiers returning to england saw a civilian population largely unaware of or unaffected by the war. british officers did initially refuse to evacuate french soldiers, although churchill later insisted that the french be evacuated alongside the british. the realism of the film was acknowledged by dunkirk veterans, although branagh said that some thought it was "louder than the battle".

although some events are based on true history, the characters and the storyline are fictional; branagh's role is a composite character. when the beach scenes were shot, the weather was worse than during the real evacuation; nolan explained that this helped to understand the danger faced by the pleasure boats. in one scene, a non commissioned officer gives a salute without wearing his military beret, which a veteran pointed out as inaccurate protocol.  to differentiate the german planes, their noses were painted yellow; this was not actually done until a month after dunkirk. the involvement of french, african and indian soldiers in the evacuation was either limited or left out in the film. contemporary shots were used for aerial views of the town, whereas dunkirk was in ruins by the time of the evacuation. the design of the airborne leaflet propaganda was similar to those used in 1940, although the originals were not in colour.
