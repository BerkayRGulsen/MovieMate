the greeks had a word for them (also known as three broadway girls) is a 1932 american pre-code comedy film directed by lowell sherman, produced by samuel goldwyn, and released by united artists. it stars ina claire, joan blondell, and madge evans and is based on the play the greeks had a word for it by zoe akins. the studio originally wanted actress jean harlow for the lead after her success in public enemy (1931), but she was under contract to howard hughes, and he refused to loan her out. the film served as inspiration for films such as three blind mice (1938), moon over miami (1941), and how to marry a millionaire (1953).
ladies in love (1936) also has a similar pattern and produced like "three blind mice" by darryl f. zanuck.
