monsters is a 2010 british science-fiction horror film written and directed by gareth edwards in his feature-film directorial debut. edwards also served as the cinematographer, production designer, and visual effects artist. monsters takes place years after a nasa probe crashed in mexico, which led to the sudden appearance of giant tentacled monsters. it follows andrew kaulder (scoot mcnairy), an american photojournalist tasked with escorting his employer's daughter samantha wynden (whitney able) back to the united states by crossing through mexico's "infected zone" where the creatures reside.
edwards conceived the idea for the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. he pitched the idea to vertigo films, who suggested he watch in search of a midnight kiss, a low-budget film starring mcnairy. edwards cast mcnairy and able in the lead roles. principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.
monsters premiered at south by southwest on 13 march 2010. hours later, magnet releasing acquired the rights to distribute it in north america. it had a limited release there, beginning on 29 october 2010, followed by a theatrical release in the united kingdom on 3 december 2010. the film received generally positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing us$ 4.2 million against a budget of less than $500,000. monsters: dark continent, a sequel, was released in the uk on 1 may 2015.


== plot ==
after a nasa space probe (sent to verify the existence of extraterrestrial life in the solar system) crash-lands in mexico, extraterrestrial life forms spread throughout the mexicounited states border region, leading to the quarantine of the northern half of mexico. us and mexican troops battle to contain the creatures, and a huge wall stretching along the border ostensibly keeps the us protected.
american photojournalist andrew kaulder (scoot mcnairy) receives a call from his employer, who tasks andrew with finding his daughter, samantha wynden (whitney able), and escorting her back to the us. andrew locates samantha in a mexican hospital and the pair board a train, until learning the tracks ahead have been damaged. they discover that if they do not leave the country within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked for six months. andrew and samantha decide to hitchhike their way to the coast. andrew buys samantha an expensive ferry ticket for the next morning. after enjoying the local nightlife together, andrew sleeps with a local woman who steals their passports. unable to board the ferry, samantha is forced to barter her engagement ring for passage through the quarantine zone.
they travel by riverboat until being transferred to a group of armed escorts who are to lead them overland to the mexicous border. the convoy is attacked by the creatures. andrew and samantha escape, but none of the guards survive. continuing on, they discover the bodies of dead travellers and bond at the top of an ancient pyramid in sight of the us border wall. by the time they reach the border, the creatures have crossed into the united states. andrew and samantha travel through a severely damaged, evacuated town in texas, find an abandoned gas station with power and call the army for help.
while waiting for help to arrive, they make phone calls to their respective families. a lone creature silently approaches the station. hiding, samantha observes several tentacles exploring the inside of the store, seemingly soaking up a television's light. samantha quickly unplugs the television and the creature loses interest. another creature appears, and they communicate with one another and possibly mate via light impulses. the creatures leave as the military arrives. samantha and andrew kiss before they are rushed into different vehicles. the chronological ending takes place at the beginning of the film, filmed in green night vision sight, when the military rescue team is attacked by a single creature.


== production ==


=== development ===
while attending university in 1996, edwards made a short monster movie set in suburbia. he initially wanted to expand on that idea, but after the release of war of the worlds, he believed it was "not going to be special anymore". considering that the film would have to be low-budget, edwards decided to embrace the found footage style of the blair witch project, and mix that element with his original concept. after learning about cloverfield's similar premise, he abandoned this idea and moved on to a concept where a "war [is] going on somewhere on the other side of the world, and no one cares".edwards conceived the film while watching some fishermen struggling to haul in their net and imagining a monster inside of it. he had the idea to make a monster movie set "years after most other monster movies end, when people aren't running and screaming, but life is going on" and "where a giant, dead sea monster is considered completely normal".


=== pre-production ===
edwards pitched his idea to vertigo films, where producer james richardson asked him to watch in search of a midnight kiss for an example of low-budget filmmaking. it starred scoot mcnairy and had been made for $15,000. edwards was impressed by mcnairy but wanted a real couple to portray the lead characters. mcnairy sent edwards a picture of his girlfriend, actress whitney able, who edwards initially thought was "too good-looking". he changed his mind after meeting them and cast them both.


=== filming ===

the film was written and directed by gareth edwards, while allan niblo and james richardson of vertigo films served as producers. edwards did not storyboard or script the film, but wrote a treatment of the story and outlines that detailed specifics points that needed to be hit in dialogue. the filming equipment cost approximately $15,000, and the production budget came in "way under" $500,000. the film was able to be made on such a low budget largely due to the production using consumer grade prosumer level equipment instead of professional paraphernalia. for instance, the film was shot using digital video cameras rather than the more expensive 35mm film and was edited on a laptop computer. many of the locations in the film were used without permission, and most of the extras were people who were already at the locations. as the extras were non-actors who were persuaded to be in the film, their actions were improvised.the film was shot in belize, mexico, guatemala, costa rica, and the united states over three weeks. for about 90% of the principal photography, the crew consisted of seven people transported in one van: edwards, able, mcnairy, sound operator ian maclagan, line producer jim spencer, mexican fixer verity oswin, and a driver.


=== editing and effects ===
every night after shooting, editor colin goudie and his assistant justin hall would download the footage so the memory sticks could be cleared and ready for the next day. while new footage was being captured, the previously filmed footage was edited at the production team's hotel. after filming concluded, the crew had over 100 hours of footage. the original cut was over four hours long but was trimmed to 94 minutes after eight months of editing. edwards originally had the ending of the film both at the beginning and the end. he and the film's producers disagreed about the placement, so he decided to put the chronological ending of the film at the beginning and end the film immediately after andrew and samantha kiss.edwards created the visual effects himself using off-the-shelf adobe software, zbrush, and autodesk 3ds max. he had five months to create all 250 visual effects shots, a process he undertook in his bedroom. he produced two shots a day until he reached the first creature shot, when "suddenly two months went by and [he] still hadn't finished a single creature shot"; edwards stated that the creatures' visual effects were the most challenging element of production. due to time constraints, the sound effects had to be produced before the visual effects.
