== plot ==
herb brooks (kurt russell), head ice hockey coach at the university of minnesota, interviews with the united states olympic committee for the national team coach's job, discussing his philosophy on how to beat the soviet team, calling for changes to the practice schedule and strategy. the usoc is skeptical, but ultimately gives brooks the job.
brooks meets his assistant coach craig patrick (noah emmerich) at the tryouts in colorado springs. brooks selects a preliminary roster of 26, indifferent to the preferences of senior usoc hockey officials, after only a day. needing to cut the roster to 20 before the olympics, he convinces usoc executive director walter bush (sean mccann)  that he has their best interests at heart. bush reluctantly agrees to take the heat from the committee for brooks' decisions.
during the initial practice, tempers flare as forward rob mcclanahan (nathan west) and defenseman jack o'callahan (michael mantenuto) get into a fight based on college rivalry. brooks allows the fight to go on so they can get the bad blood out of their systems and then he bluntly tells all the players that they are to let go of old rivalries and start becoming a team. he then calls for introductions and the players each tell their name, hometown and which team they play for. as practices continue, brooks uses unorthodox methods to winnow the roster down to 20 players. the players themselves worry about being cut at any time, knowing that brooks himself was the last player cut from the 1960 olympic hockey team that won the gold medal, so he will do anything to win.
during an exhibition game against norway in oslo that ends in a 33 tie, brooks notices the players are distracted and not playing up to their potential. after the game, he orders them back on the ice for a bag skate. brooks has them skate from one end of the ice to the other several times (doing, in other words, his infamous "herbies," as the team would call them colloquially), continuing the drill even after the rink manager cuts the power. exhausted, forward and team captain mike eruzione (patrick o'brien demsey) re-introduces himself in the same matter from the initial practice and cries out that he plays for the united states. getting the answer he wanted all along, brooks finally tells the players they are done. eventually, the team comes together, with the players thinking of themselves as a family representing the united states. with their roster finalized, just before heading to lake placid, the americans play the soviets in an exhibition game at madison square garden. the soviets manhandle the young american team, winning by a score of 103. during the game, o'callahan receives an injury that could keep him out of the entire olympics, and starting goaltender jim craig (eddie cahill) is shockingly told he may be benched in favor of backup steve janaszak (sam skoryna). brooks tells him that he hasn't been giving his very best and ultimately decides to keep craig as the starter for the olympics.
as the 1980 winter olympics begins, the americans trail sweden 21 in the first game. brooks fires up the team during an intermission by accusing an injured mcclanahan of quitting. mcclanahan ends up playing despite his injury, which inspires the team. bill baker (nick postle) scores a goal with less than a minute remaining in the third period for a dramatic 22 tie. they then follow up with a 73 win over heavily favored czechoslovakia. as the olympics continue, the team defeats norway, romania, and west germany to earn a spot in the medal round. the americans are considered overwhelming underdogs to the soviets in the first medal round game. the game begins and the soviets score the first goal. then o'callahan, having healed enough from his injury, enters the game for the first time. he makes an immediate impact by heavily checking vladimir krutov on a play that leads to a goal by buzz schneider (billy schneider). the soviets score again to retake the lead. in the final seconds, soviet goalie vladislav tretiak stops a long shot by dave christian (stephen kovalcik), but mark johnson (eric peter-kaiser) gets the rebound and scores with less than one second left in the period.
during the first intermission, soviet coach viktor tikhonov (zinaid memievi) replaces tretiak with backup vladimir myshkin. in the second period, the soviets score a goal to go up 32. early in the final period, the soviet team is called for a penalty, putting the americans on the power play. johnson scores his second goal of the game just as the penalty is about to expire. later, eruzione puts them ahead 43 with 10 minutes left. the americans hold off the soviets to win the game, completing one of the biggest upsets in sports history. two days later, the team would go on to defeat finland 42 to win the gold medal. the movie ends with brooks staring out over his team with pride as the entire team crowds together on the gold medal platform.
before the credits, the film is dedicated to herb brooks who unfortunately died right before principal photography was finished and states he never saw it. he lived it.

== production ==
gavin o'connor directed and mark ciardi produced the movie.  both are drawn to inspirational stories and they decided to take on the "greatest sports moment of the 20th century". they chose to focus on the determination and focus of coach herb brooks. o'connor knew from the beginning that he wanted to cast kurt russell as herb brooks because he needed someone with an athletic background and a fiery passion for sports. the casting of the team consisted of real hockey players to give the film a raw and accurate feel. o'connor figured it would be easier to teach hockey players to act than to teach actors to play hockey. on-ice tryouts were held in new york, boston, minneapolis, los angeles, toronto, and vancouver. another tryout was held in vancouver for the soviet and european teams.
there are a total of 133 different hockey plays in the film. to accomplish this, the directors turned to reelsports solutions, who had helped with the producers on a previous movie, the rookie. the reelsports team referred to coach herb brooks for information on practices, plays, equipment, and uniform styles. each fight and stunt scene was choreographed to ensure the actors' safety. players went through a six-week training camp to relearn the game in older equipment.sadly, coach brooks died in a car accident before the movie was released. at the end, before the credits it states, "this film is dedicated to the memory of herb brooks, who died shortly following principal photography. he never saw it. he lived it."
