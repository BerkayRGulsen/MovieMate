== plot ==
bobby gold is a homicide detective on the trail of robert randolph, a drug-dealer and cop-killer on the fbi's ten most wanted list. en route to nab an accomplice of randolph, gold and his partner tim sullivan happen upon a murder scene: the elderly jewish owner of a candy store in a ghetto has been gunned down, reportedly for a fortune hidden in her basement. the deceased woman's son, a doctor, uses his clout to have gold assigned to the case in the belief that gold, himself jewish, might be empathetic to his plight. gold, however, seems to disregard his ethnicity and is irritated about being pulled off a much higher-profile case. ultimately, though, this is offset by interactions with members of the jewish community that play on gold's feelings of inadequacy and inability to fit in.
a nighttime survey of the crime scene uncovers an important piece of the woman's past, and gold's reluctance turns to curiosity, leading to the discovery of a zionist organization operating in the city. the apparent power and sense of pride these people have is appealing to gold, and he attempts to become a part of their group. gold is thrust into a series of circumstances that test not only his loyalty to the badge, but also his newfound jewish consciousness.
