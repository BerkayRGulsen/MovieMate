the police from upstate call the tynes to say their daughter's been arrested 300 miles away, for stealing. the two rush to see her, only to find that it is the divitos' girl in custody, having given the police a false name. on the trip back home, they stop off at a hotel, where ike & tina turner are performing. a drunk lynn is followed back to their room by an amorous stranger, unaware that larry is already asleep in the bed. after the stranger disappears, lynn tries out some of the tips margot had confided to her earlier.
later, back in the city, larry and lynn attend a formal dinner for the self-help group. afterwards, marijuana joints are handed round, and a young man named schiavelli instructs the parents on how to smoke them. happily high, larry and lynn take ann and her husband ben back to their home for more drinks and a game of strip poker. as the group gets more inebriated, a naked larry jumps on top of the table to sing "libiamo ne' lieti calici". at this point, jeannie reappears and the guests hastily leave.
when jeannie admits to having been with a boy, larry suggests she brings him home for dinner soon. when he appears, he proves to be an intelligent and wealthy musician. however, he declines to play for them, upon which larry entertains the four with "stranger in paradise".
