== background ==
the two comedic actors conway and knotts achieved success onscreen when they were paired in several family-friendly feature films for disney: the apple dumpling gang (1975), gus (1976), and the apple dumpling gang rides again (1979). as boxing and wrestling movies were popular in the 1970s and '80s, choosing the subject for a slapstick comedy seemed like a good idea. knotts and conway would team up yet again in 1981 for the private eyes.

the film earned $6.5 million during its initial release and was one of the most financially successful films ever released by new world pictures, having earned more than twice the cost of its production.
