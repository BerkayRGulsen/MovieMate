after continuing to resist joining the ring, tomas is set-up and painfully discovers (having his arm broken by a tyre iron) the group of car thieves involved in "midnite spares" (the stealing and chopping of cars to send interstate) were responsible for ted's untimely death. the thieves are headed by bent police detective howard (tony barry) and dodgy businessmen vincent (john clayton) and sidebottom (graeme blundell). steve and tomas' tow truck drivers wimpy (bruce spence), rabbit (david argue), and their friends pursue the criminals and attempt to capture them, following tomas' advice to steve "don't get angry son, get even."
steve also meets and falls in love with ruth mintos (gia carides) and the pair have to convince her old fashioned mother maria (tessa mallos) as well as her uncle harry (terry camilleri) that they want to be together and get married. steve also tries to prove his prowess at the wheel of a sprintcar at sydney's parramatta city raceway against sydney and australia's leading drivers including garry rush, george tatnell, rob worthington (who also doubled as steve when racing), terry becker, bob blacklaw and steve brazier.
