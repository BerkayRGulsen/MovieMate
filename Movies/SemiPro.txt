== plot ==
in 1976, jackie moon is a singer who used the profits from his one-hit wonder, "love me sexy", to buy a basketball team in the american basketball association (aba), the flint tropics, becoming the owner, head coach, starting power forward, and pre-game announcer. the aba commissioner announces a plan to merge the league with the national basketball association (nba), but only four teams will move to the more established league. the tropics, the worst team in the league, are in danger of dissolving. jackie argues that the teams with the four best records should be merged and the commissioner accepts.
jackie trades the team's washing machine to the kentucky colonels for ed monix, a backup point guard who won an nba championship with the boston celtics, but did not play during the playoffs. the commissioner reveals that in addition to finishing in the top four, the tropics will also need at least 2,000 fans at every remaining home game. jackie begins to stage extremely desperate stunts in order to boost attendance, like wrestling a bear named dewey, as well as the increased intensity of clarence withers, the tropics' best player. monix takes over as offensive and defensive coordinator and starting point guard, leaving jackie as the head coach. monix trains the team rigorously with a play he calls the "puke", as the players are to run it until they literally throw up.
from monix's training, the tropics go on a winning run, moving from last to fifth. jackie gets a visit from the commissioner. the nba does not think that flint has a large enough media market and will not allow the tropics into the league even if they beat the first place san antonio spurs in the last game of the season. jackie admits that he stole "love me sexy" from a napkin his mother wrote on three weeks before she died. realizing that all his assets are basically stolen, jackie trades withers to the spurs so that he may realize his dream of playing in the nba. monix inspires the team to leave everything on the court, while they may not be able to continue the franchise after this season, they have come very far and still have a lot to prove.
going into the spurs game, which jackie declares the "megabowl", the tropics are in fifth place and with a win they would make it into fourth, even though they will not be allowed into the nba. the tropics fall behind quickly, and jackie is knocked unconscious when fouled hard at the end of the first half. withers decides he has seen enough and rejoins the tropics in their locker room, destroying his chance at the nba with the spurs. an unconscious jackie imagines that he is in heaven with his mother. he apologizes for stealing her song and she gives him a weapon in order to win. starting the second half, the tropics reveal their new weapon: the alley-oop. with the return of withers, the alley-oop is very effective, but the referee initially calls the play a foul. after some persuasion by jackie and monix, the referee is convinced that it is a legitimate play. with seconds left, they have closed to within two points, 117115, when the spurs execute a defence against the alley-oop. monix calls a time-out and tells them to run the "puke", executing multiple razzle-dazzle passes ending with the ball in jackie's hands under the net  but he gets fouled hard again with two seconds left, giving him 2 free throws. shooting granny style, jackie sinks the first basket. the second bounces off the rim but monix tips it in right at the buzzer for two points to win, sparking a wild celebration in the arena and the streets of flint.
the spurs' coach offers withers his position back, while the now-former aba commissioner offers jackie a position on the staff of the nba assistant commissioner, as a marketing director.
