== plot ==
the three intercut stories that comprise poison are:

hero: seven-year-old richie shoots his abusive father and then flies away. the story is told in the style of an episode of a tabloid television news magazine.
horror: told in the style of a "psychotropic horror film" of the mid-1960s, horror is about a scientist who isolates the "elixir of human sexuality" and, after drinking it, is transformed into a hideous murdering leper.
homo: the story of a prisoner, john broom, who finds himself attracted to another prisoner, jack bolton, whom he had known and seen humiliated as a youth in a juvenile facility.  it is an adaptation of part of genet's miracle of the rose (1946).
