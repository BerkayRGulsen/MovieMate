years pass when ray gorman (buster crabbe) comes to the area on the fringes of the jungle where the plane crashed.  bar owner carl hurst (barton maclane) and his female associate marie (fifi d'orsay) spy on gorman to see what he's up to.  
gorman's father was head of the bank that stockwell worked for and robbed; when gorman's father was blamed for the theft he committed suicide.  gorman is out to recover the loot from the plane crash to clear his father's name.  when gorman saves hurst's servant tobo (prince modupe) from being murdered by another african (fred toones), tobo confides in gorman that there is a white witch in the jungle who legend has it came from the sky.  gorman realises that this could be a reference to stockwell's plane crash and disappearance. tobo offers to lead gorman to the area whilst hurst and marie secretly follow.

guinea born prince modupe according to his autobiography i was a savage/royal african was a hollywood technical advisor on african films  such as sundown  and the snows of kilimanjaro.  he gives not only a highly sympathetic portrayal of an african, but one who is a friend rather than a servant of crabbe.  in addition to fighting men and a crocodile, crabbe displays amusing bob hope type comedy when frightened by julie london's killer gorilla.
