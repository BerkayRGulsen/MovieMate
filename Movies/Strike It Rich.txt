== production ==
ringwald wrote in the new yorker that the film was partly rewritten (and later recut and retitled) at the behest of harvey weinstein after she had signed on to it, and that she felt that she and lindsay "were essentially asked to turn our backs on [scott] and film scenes that were not what we had agreed to"; she also alleges that she was eventually forced to sue weinstein for her promised share of the gross. lindsay largely corroborated this story to the bbc, and asserted that he had confronted weinstein over the script changes and lost career opportunities as a result.it was patrick holt 's last film appearance.
