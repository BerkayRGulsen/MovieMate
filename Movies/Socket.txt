== reception ==
don willmott from filmcritic.com also noted "low-powered sci-fi exercise is actually a soft-core gay skin flick masquerading as some kind of "thriller" ".
martin gray from eyeforfilm.co.uk was more savage about the film, saying "thriller isn't the word i'd use to describe the film - "borer" maybe. "stupid", "insulting" and "witless" also come to mind. let's be generous and go for a phrase or two such as "badly written" and "ineptly acted"."
