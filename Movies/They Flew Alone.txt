== plot ==
the film chronicles the life of amy johnson, the british pilot who had gained world attention in the 1930s for her exploits, among them two solo record flights from london to cape town in south africa, and who had joined the air transport auxiliary at the outbreak of the second world war. it was intended to be both a film honouring johnson, who had died in 1941 during a ferry flight of an airspeed oxford, and a propaganda call to arms at the height of the war years.
