the ghost camera is a 1933 british mystery film directed by bernard vorhaus, starring henry kendall, ida lupino and john mills, and based on "a mystery narrative", a short story by joseph jefferson farjeon.
despite being made quickly on a low budget, the film has come to be considered as one of the most successful quota quickies made during the thirties.

the film's director, bernard vorhaus, had arrived in britain from america in 1930 and established himself as a director of quota films in britain's rapidly growing film industry. his films became notable for featuring rapid editing (he often used the young david lean as editor, who claimed that vorhaus was a major early influence on him) and location shooting, both of which were relatively rare for supporting films.
