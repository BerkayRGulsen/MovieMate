=== critical response ===
upon its theatrical release, angel eyes received mixed reviews. on the review aggregator web site rotten tomatoes, the film holds a 33% positive rating from critics based on 132 reviews. the site's consensus states: "though the earlier part of the movie suggested something more, the movie turns out to be nothing more than a schmaltzy romance."in his review in the chicago sun-times, roger ebert gave the film three of four stars and applauding the performance of jennifer lopez, whom he describes as "the real thing, one of those rare actresses who can win our instinctive sympathy. she demonstrates that in angel eyes. ebert noted that although the film is a cop movie, "its real story doesn't involve the police, it involves damaged lives and the possibility that love can heal." ebert concludes:

angel eyes is a complex, evasive romance involving two people who both want to be inaccessible. it's intriguing to see their dance of attraction and retreat. meanwhile, secrets about both their family situations emerge; credit the screenwriter, gerald dipego, for not resolving the standoff with the father with an easy payoff.
in his review in the san francisco chronicle, mick lasalle called the film "a rare thinga well-acted character study of a hardworking woman, by a screenwriter (gerald dipego) and a director with enough integrity to dispense with the usual hollywood distractions." lasalle concluded:

with angel eyes, audiences will see a new relaxation in jennifer lopez. she takes her time. she really listens. she reacts. she doesn't try to control scenes or control her face. she lets moments happen. credit director luis mandoki, or maturity, or confidence, or an actress' finding the right role. whatever the reasons, lopez, who was always competent onscreen, is now an actress who can do things other movie stars can't do. she doesn't push, just thinks, and her thoughts and emotions burn into the film.
in his review in the new york times, stephen holden focused his critique on the casting, writing, "watching these two share some awkward smooches that are supposed to transport them over the moon is a little like imagining jane russell and montgomery clift in a steamy clinch." holden concludes:

throughout angel eyes you are aware of consuming a market-tested product whose eerie atmosphere and tone of bogus solemnity suggest that mr. mandoki was given specific instructions to create a hybrid of city of angels, the sixth sense and frequency. he may have delivered, but the product is so synthetic it has only attitude where its heart ought to be.
