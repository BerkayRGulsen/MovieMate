== controversy ==
in the novel, ann vickers is a birth control advocate and reformer who has two extramarital affairs, each time becoming pregnant though unwed. the original screenplay, following sinclair lewis's novel, had her obtaining an abortion, but the story was changed so that she gives birth to a child who dies.  the screenplay for the 1933 film was approved by the production code only when rko radio pictures also agreed to make vickers an unmarried woman at the time of her affairs, thus eliminating the issue of adultery.the reaction of leading american roman catholics to the content in this film and the sign of the cross led to the formation in 1934 of the catholic legion of decency, an organization dedicated to identifying and combating what it viewed as objectionable content in films, usually by threatening a boycott.
