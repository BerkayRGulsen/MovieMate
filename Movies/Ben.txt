however, things gradually take a downhill turn as ben's colony becomes violent in its search for food, resulting in several deaths. eventually, the police destroy the rat colony with flame throwers after trapping them in the sewers, but ben somehow survives and makes his way back to danny. a tearful and overjoyed danny tends to the injured ben, determined not to lose his only real best friend.

== theme song ==
the film's theme song "ben" is performed by lee montgomery in the film and by michael jackson during the final scene and ending credits. jackson's recording of the song became a number 1 pop hit single. later included as the title track on jackson's second solo album, ben, it won a golden globe award for best original song and was nominated for an academy award for best original song (it lost to "the morning after" by maureen mcgovern from another 1972 film, the poseidon adventure).
the song is calm and mellow, which contrasts with the horror content of the film. a live recorded version was released on the album the jacksons live! (1981) and eventually appeared on michael jackson's album number ones (2003).
crispin glover recorded a version of the song for the soundtrack of the 2003 remake of willard. a music video for this version was produced, which also featured glover.
pearl jam's song "rats" refers to the film  ben; the last line of the song is an obvious reference to the michael jackson song "ben". the line, "ben, the two of us need look no more", is repeated multiple times as the song fades out.
