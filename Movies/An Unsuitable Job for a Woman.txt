== reception ==
goldcrest films provided 316,000, just under half the budget. jake eberts of goldcrest said he was reluctant to invest in the film but had been persuaded by david puttnam's enthusiasm for the director. the film was a financial disappointment and goldcrest made a loss of 120,000.in a review in the new york times, janet maslin wrote "as befits an english country house mystery, the film has enough wood paneling, wildflowers and overall gentility to appeal to the genre's most ardent fans. but a couple of the film's transitions are abrupt enough to make the head spin, and its final action sequences are woefully perfunctory. the denouement is as disappointing as mr. petit's inability to breathe life into cordelia, her sleuthing and her peculiar obsession." a review in variety summarized; "perhaps it is unfair to unravel this tale which is handled from a distance by director christopher petit robbing it of a more forceful narration, timing and revelation."
