hollywood and vine, the intersection of hollywood boulevard and vine street in hollywood, a district of los angeles, became known in the 1920s for its concentration of radio and movie-related businesses. the hollywood walk of fame is centered on the intersection.
few production facilities are still located in the immediate area.  one of the few remaining is the capitol records tower to the north of the intersection.
the namesake subway station for the metro b line is located directly below the intersection, but the entrance/exit to the station is located one block east at hollywood and argyle avenue. the intersection is located in zip code 90028.


== history ==

the area was a lemon grove until 1903, when daeida beveridge allowed one corner of the dirt intersection on her property to be used for the building of the hollywood memorial church for the local german methodist population.
the streets were renamed in 1910, when the city of hollywood was merged with los angeles.
beginning in the 1920s, during the golden age of hollywood, the area began to see an influx of money and influence as movie and music businesses moved to the district, turning the local farms and orchards into movie backlots. hollywood and vine was the second busiest intersection in the area, after wilshire boulevard and western avenue.in the 1930s, radio station kfwb spoke of "broadcasting live from hollywood and vine," and newspaper columnists hedda hopper and jimmie fidler regularly touted the intersection's mystique.in 1958, the intersection became the central point of the newly installed hollywood walk of fame. later neil armstrong, buzz aldrin and michael collins, the astronauts of the first lunar landing mission apollo 11, were awarded television stars for coverage of the mission, and given the places of honor at the corner of hollywood and vine.
by the 1960s, however, many studios and broadcasters had moved onto more upscale areas, and the area fell into disrepair and disrepute, with many abandoned stores and offices, and the streets themselves, claimed by squatters and panhandlers. it took several decades for redevelopment to take hold, and visitors looking for hollywood dreams were often taken aback by the area's contrast with shinier tourist meccas.
the hollywood/vine subway station opened in 1999, and led to more sustained and serious redevelopment in the area. on may 29, 2003, hollywood and vine was named "bob hope square" to commemorate hope's 100th birthday.
in urban folklore, many of the local buildings are considered to be part of "haunted hollywood", home to the ghosts of celebrities (and less stellar residents) of hollywood's legendary past. the intersection has been mentioned or alluded to in dozens of songs, films, video games, music videos and other popular media, often as a symbol of hollywood's lure as a destination for dreamers, or for its decadence and disappointments.


=== historic buildings ===

the first "high-rise" building at hollywood and vine was the 12-story taft building, built in 1923 on the southeast corner on the site of the old memorial church. it was built for a.z. taft jr. by architects walker & eisen, in the renaissance revival style. "in hollywood's golden age, all the studios had offices there," said hollywood chamber of commerce president leron gubler, including charlie chaplin and will rogers. from 1935 to 1945, it was home to the academy of motion picture arts and sciences offices.

on the northwest corner, the laemmle building was built in the international style in 1932 by architect richard neutra for carl laemmle, head of universal pictures. unfortunately, the original drawing depicting the design that neutra intended was not built because of the 1929 stock market crash. it was significantly altered from 1940, and retained few of its original features. the building was gutted by fire in april 2008, and razed in october 2008. to the west of the laemmle building is another landmark international style building, by neutra's friend and rival rudolf schindler. the building was originally known for sardi's diner, and is now home to the cave theater.
to the north of the laemmle building is a spanish colonial style building housing the avalon hollywood, opened on january 24, 1927, as the hollywood playhouse and designed by the architectural firm of h. l. gogerty and carl jules weyl. the building's name has changed many times over the 20th century, but was known as the hollywood palace for many years before its most recent renaming.
