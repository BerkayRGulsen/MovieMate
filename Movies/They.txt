== evaluation of the year ==
renowned american film critic and professor emanuel levy stated on his website, "despite films like crash, which deals with racism in contemporary america, and geopolitical exposes like syriana  and munich, the 2005 movie year may go down in film history as the year of sexual diversity." he went on to emphasize, "it's hard to recall a year in which sex, sexuality, and gender have featured so prominently in american films, both mainstream hollywood and independent cinema. i am deliberately using the concepts of sexual diversity and sexual orientation, rather than gay-themed movies, because the rather new phenomenon goes beyond homosexuality or lesbianism. for decades, american culture has been both puritanical and hypocritical as far as sexual matters are concerned. hence, most american movies, such as spielberg's e.t. and others, have ignored the fact that children have sexual urges, a libido. compared with european cinema (particularly french and british), there's been discomfort to address directly sexual issues. things began to change over the past decade, when gay characters became routine in hollywood movies and tv soaps. just witness the popularity of will and grace and queer eye for the straight guy, and the fact that there are specifically targeted gay cable channels." in terms of the graphic portrayal of sex in movies, levy stated, "in the past, hollywood was afraid to depict homosexual love on screen (both gay and lesbian). thirty years ago, audiences were shocked when peter finch kissed murray in sunday bloody sunday. but no more. though brokeback mountain is about repressed sexuality, the movie contains a graphic scene, an anal intercourse between ennis del mar and jake, never before seen on screen. in transamerica, a key scene depicts the penis of one of the central characters and fellatio in the car. in history of violence, two of the strongest scenes involve sex between husband and wife tom and edie stall (played by viggo mortensen and maria bello). as writer-director and actor, woody allen has been obsessed with sex, or rather talks about sex, in his films. yet arguably, he has never portrayed sex in a steamy and alluring way as he does in match point. just watch the passionate embrace between scarlett johnasson  [sic] and jonathan rhys meyers, when they are caught but undeterred by heavy rains, a visual clich in film noir that nonetheless works well for this movie." levy also stated, "what's encouraging about the new movies is that, with few exceptions, the sexual orientation of the characters is not an issue, and they are not about the traumatic experience of coming out."
