== reception ==
the film received positive reviews at the time and is still regarded as an excellent 'snapshot' of the alternative newspaper era. matthew monagle of film school rejects writes:what makes between the lines such a timely film even decades later is its depiction of the diminishing space offered journalism in a world of corporate takeovers. pages of copy are cut to make way for more advertisements; writers are asked to choose between walking out and compromising their integrity. the film makes it clear that the back bay mainline, even in its diminished capacity, still has its finger on the pulse of the boston community in a way no major newspaper could. when that is gone, something vital goes with it...those looking for the newspaper industrys answer to broadcast news will find a welcome film in between the lines. the film has countless moments of insight into the struggle of the american journalist, from the staffs shabby living conditions  the film offers perhaps the most realistic look at big city apartments ever committed to film  to how well-meaning writers navigate the competing interests of truth and financial trendlines. with an all-star cast and some great comedic bits  enjoy watching goldblum engage in a battle with a local performance artist at the back bay mainline headquarters  between the lines is a late addition to the already impressive canon of essential 1970s cinema.
