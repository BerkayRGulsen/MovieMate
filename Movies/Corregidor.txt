== reception ==
film historian alun evans reviewed corregidor in brassey's guide to war films (2000), comparing and contrasting it to other contemporary features also dealing with the fall of the philippines, bataan (1943), the eve of st. mark, (1944) and they were expendable (1945). he noted that " (director) nigh was the first to cash in on the fall of the philippines island to the japanese in may 1942, but turned it into a turgid romance."
