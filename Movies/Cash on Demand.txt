== critical reception ==
cash on demand was selected by the film historians steve chibnall and brian mcfarlane as one of the 15 most meritorious british b films made between the second world war and 1970. they note that it also received enthusiastic reviews at the time of its release from the monthly film bulletin and kinematograph weekly. they particularly praise peter cushing: "above all, it is peter cushing's performance of the austere man, to whom efficiency matters most (though the film is subtle enough to allow him a certain integrity as well), and who will be frightened into a warmer sense of humanity, that lifts the film well above the perfunctory levels of much 'b' film-making."
