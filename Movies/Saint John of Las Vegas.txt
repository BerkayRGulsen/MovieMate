a compulsive gambler attempts to cure his addiction by moving from las vegas to albuquerque and working at an auto insurance company, only to find old temptations cropping up once again when he's sent out to investigate a dubious car accident just outside sin city.
after a string of bad luck at the tables, john (steve buscemi) decides to give up gambling and take a shot at a "normal" life. arriving in albuquerque and landing a job at an auto insurance company, john goes to work for mr. townsend (peter dinklage), who pairs him with the company's top fraud debunker, virgil (romany malco), and sends them out on an investigation together. while john is eager to get a promotion, he's reluctant to go anywhere near las vegas, and before he leaves he strikes up a tenuous romance with his eccentric co-worker, jill (sarah silverman).
on the road, virgil and john encounter a series of offbeat characters including ned, a nude militant (tim blake nelson), tasty d lite, a wheelchair-using stripper (emmanuelle chriqui), and a carnival human torch (john cho). but while virgil is the one with the experience, john gradually begins to assert himself and soon his efforts begin to pay off as the case moves closer to conclusion. as john's confidence grows, he becomes increasingly aware of the fact that running away from his gambling problem is not the solution, and that he'll only be able to move forward by returning to las vegas to face his demons head on.
