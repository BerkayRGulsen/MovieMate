== reception ==
writing for night and day in 1937, graham greene gave the film a poor review, characterizing it simply as "one of the dullest films of the year". greene's chief complaints came from the plot, writing, and "middlebrow" dialogue which inelegantly attempted to bridge "poetic and realistic drama". greene also notes a number of scenes or moments of "unconscious comedy" which undermined the film and let to a feeling of "great fake emotions booming out - love, country, ambition".
