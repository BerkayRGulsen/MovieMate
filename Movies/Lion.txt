=== critical reception ===
the film received mixed reviews from critics.
123telugu.com rated 3/5 and stated on the whole, lion is a complete balakrishna film right from the word go. his power packed performance is the major asset and will go down well with the masses. on the flip side, lack of proper handling of the subject and a predictable second half makes this film just an ok watch. watch it only for balayya. idlebrain rated 3/5 and stated interval episode is interesting. second half has many episodes that exhilarate fans. lion is a film that completely revolves around balakrishna and depends on his performance. a good screenplay and right buildups (elevating emotions while building up to the key scenes) would have done a world of good to the cinema. on a whole, lion is nbk's show! the hindu stated radhika wears a blank expression. there is another gem, a man confronts balaiyya, natho matladataniki yentha dhairyam neeku and the latter retorts neetho matladataniki dhairyam enduku...iphone unte chaalu. lion takes plenty of retrograde steps. mani sarma too disappoints and the hero struggles with his steps. time for balakrishna to do some soul searching or his films would be just another addition to the number of films he has done.


=== box office ===
the film opened good response in ap. the film collected 5.5 crore (us$770,000) (share) at the andhra pradesh and telangana (ap/t) box office on the first day. but the film failed to break the opening day record of legend. the movie witnessed a huge drop of over 50 percent on friday and it went down further on the following days. the film has collected 11.2 crore (us$1.6 million) (share) in ap. the film collected 12 crore (us$1.7 million) (ww share) in its extended first week end at the box office but it is below par. the film collected average 15.8 crore (us$2.2 million) (ww share) in its first week and gross would be 26 crore (us$3.6 million) at the box office.
