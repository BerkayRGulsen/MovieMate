== plot ==
best friends claire and hailey are enjoying their last few days of summer together in their small beach town baybridge, near tampa, florida, before hailey moves to australia because of her mother's work as a marine biologist. hailey prays to the ocean god for a miracle that will make her mother change her mind about moving. minutes later, a violent storm occurs. the next night, the girls discover a mermaid named aquamarine in the pool. she has run away from home. they become friends and aquamarine tells them that she needs to prove to her father that true love exists or she will be forced to marry a man she does not know. aquamarine (who is able to change her tail into legs during the day as long as she does not get wet) has set her eyes on raymond, the lifeguard hailey and claire have had a crush on for years. they are reluctant but when aquamarine explains that you get a wish if you help a mermaid, they agree to help in hopes that they can prevent hailey from leaving.
because aquamarine is not human, she does not understand how love works and is rejected by raymond when they first meet. the girls promise to make raymond fall in love with her in the next three days, using strategies found in teen magazines. a group of popular girls headed by cecilia, the spoiled daughter of the local meteorologist who also has a crush on raymond, get in the way.
aquamarine and raymond bond at a party but she flees since she transforms back at sunset. before leaving, she kisses raymond and asks him to meet her on the pier in the morning. cecilia follows the three girls to the water tower where aquamarine is staying, and discovers her secret. she unhooks the ladder to prevent aquamarine from getting down and calls the news so she can expose her on national television. however, the town's mysterious handyman helps her and aquamarine grants him a wish.
the next morning, aquamarine asks raymond if he loves her. raymond admits that he likes her but has not fallen in love with her yet as they have only been on one date; he wants to get there with her slowly. aquamarine is heartbroken. cecilia interrupts and pushes her into the ocean, where aquamarine turns back into a mermaid. raymond is shocked but rushes to get his rescue board to save her, much to cecilia's angered dismay. aquamarine's father calls her back home in a giant storm but hailey and claire jump into the ocean to save her. aquamarine asks why they jumped in for her and they respond that they love her. thus, the girls learn the meaning of friendship and aquamarine proves to her father that love exists. the girls receive their wish but decide to not use it to keep hailey from moving away since her mother worked hard for it. instead, they save the wish and part ways with aquamarine, who must get back to her family. she promises she will visit them. raymond asks her to visit him as well and they kiss. back on shore, raymond thanks the girls for their bravery and for introducing him to aquamarine. the girls tell each other they will miss one another.
in the stage booklet, it is revealed that a year later claire, raymond, and aquamarine meet up with hailey in australia exploring the great coral reef together.
