== plot ==
in 1954, u.s. marshal edward "teddy" daniels and his new partner chuck aule travel to the ashecliffe hospital for the criminally insane on shutter island in boston harbor. they are investigating the disappearance of patient rachel solando, incarcerated for drowning her three children. their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in solando's room: "the law of 4; who is 67?". the two men arrive just before a massive storm, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.
teddy and chuck find the staff confrontational and uncooperative. lead psychiatrist john cawley refuses to turn over records, and they learn that solando's doctor lester sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after solando disappeared, preventing them from interrogating him. they are told that ward c, one of three, is reserved for the most severely disturbed patients and is off limits, along with the lighthouse, which has already been searched. while being interviewed, one patient writes the word "run" in teddy's notepad. teddy starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and has waking visions of his experiences as a u.s. army soldier during the liberation of dachau including reprisals against the guards. he has disturbing dreams of his wife, dolores chanal, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist andrew laeddis. in one instance, she tells teddy that solando is still on the islandas is laeddis, who everyone claims was never there. teddy later explains to chuck that locating laeddis was his ulterior motive for taking the case.
teddy and chuck find that solando has resurfaced with no explanation, prompting the former to break into the restricted ward c. teddy encounters george noyce, a patient in solitary confinement, who claims that the doctors are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. noyce warns that everyone else on the island, including chuck, is playing an elaborate game designed for teddy.
teddy regroups with chuck and climbs the cliffs toward the lighthouse. they become separated, and teddy later sees what he believes to be chuck's body on the rocks below. by the time he climbs down, the body has disappeared, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding, who claims to be the real rachel solando. she states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with psychotropic medication and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop mind control techniques. before she could report her findings to the authorities, she was forcibly committed to ashecliffe as a patient. teddy returns to the hospital, but finds no evidence of chuck ever being there.
convinced chuck was taken to the lighthouse, teddy breaks in, only to discover cawley waiting for him. cawley explains that teddy is actually andrew laeddis, their "most dangerous patient", incarcerated in ward c for murdering his manic depressive wife, dolores, after she drowned their children. edward daniels and rachel solando are anagrams of andrew laeddis and dolores chanal, and the little girl from laeddis's recurring dreams is his daughter rachel. cawley disclosed it was andrew who attacked noyce two weeks earlier for calling him laeddis. according to cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to cure andrew's conspiracy-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of teddy daniels. the hospital staff were part of the test, including lester sheehan posing as chuck aule and a nurse posing as rachel solando. andrew's migraines were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were his hallucinations of the "real rachel solando". overwhelmed, andrew faints.
he awakens in the hospital under the watch of cawley, sheehan, the warden and the nurse who played rachel solando. when questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, satisfying the doctors. cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but andrew regressed. he warns this will be andrew's last chance; otherwise, they will have to lobotomize him.
some time later, andrew relaxes on the hospital grounds with sheehan, but calls him "chuck" again, saying they must leave the island. sheehan shakes his head to cawley, to which cawley says something inaudibly to naehring and the warden and then turns away. the warden gestures to the orderlies and andrew is taken away to be lobotomized. before leaving peacefully, andrew asks sheehan if it would be worse "to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?" a stunned sheehan calls andrew "teddy" but the latter does not respond to the name. the camera pans to the lighthouse while andrew is preparing to be lobotomized.


== cast ==


== production ==
the rights to dennis lehane's novel shutter island were first optioned to columbia pictures in 2003. columbia did not act on the option, and it lapsed back to lehane, who sold it to phoenix pictures. phoenix hired laeta kalogridis, and together they developed the film for a year. director martin scorsese and actor leonardo dicaprio were both attracted to the project. production began on march 6, 2008.lehane's inspiration for the hospital and island setting was long island in boston harbor, which he had visited during the blizzard of 1978 as a child with his uncle and family.shutter island was mainly filmed in massachusetts, with taunton being the location for the world war ii flashback scenes. old industrial buildings in taunton's whittenton mills complex replicated the dachau concentration camp. the old medfield state hospital in medfield, massachusetts, was another key location. cawley's office scenes were the second floor of the chapel during the late evening. lights were shone through the windows to make it look like it was daytime. the crew painted the hospital's brick walls to look like plywood. this served the dual purpose of acting as scenery and blocking the set from view of a local road. the crew wanted to film at the old worcester state hospital, but demolition of surrounding buildings made it impossible. the stone lodge, next to leach pond, at borderland state park in easton, massachusetts, was used for the cabin scene. the film used peddocks island as a setting for the story's island. east point, in nahant, massachusetts, was the location for the lighthouse scenes. the scenes where teddy and chuck are caught in the hurricane were filmed at the wilson mountain reservation in dedham, massachusetts. filming ended on july 2, 2008.

== genre ==
shutter island is a period piece with nods to different films in the film noir and horror genres, paying particular homage to alfred hitchcock's works. scorsese stated in an interview that the main reference to teddy daniels was dana andrews's character in laura, and that he was also influenced by several very low-budget 1940s zombie movies made by val lewton. the main frame of the plot resembles that of william peter blatty's the ninth configuration, as well as the cabinet of dr. caligari. la croix noted that shutter island was a "complex and puzzling" work that borrowed from genres as diverse as detective, fantasy, and the psychological thriller.there have been differing opinions over the ending of the film, in which laeddis asks dr. sheehan, "[w]hich would be worse  to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?", a line that does not appear in the book. professor james gilligan of new york university was scorsese's psychiatric adviser, and he said that laeddis's last words mean: "i feel too guilty to go on living. i'm not going to actually commit suicide, but i'm going to vicariously commit suicide by handing myself over to these people who're going to lobotomize me." dennis lehane, however, said, "personally, i think he has a momentary flash. it's just one moment of sanity mixed in the midst of all the other delusions."


== release ==

the film was scheduled to be released by paramount pictures in the united states and canada on october 2, 2009. paramount later announced it was going to push back the release date to february 19, 2010. reports attribute the pushback to paramount not having "the financing in 2009 to spend the $50 to $60 million necessary to market a big awards pic like this", to dicaprio's unavailability to promote the film internationally, and to paramount's hope that the economy might rebound enough by february 2010 that a film geared toward adult audiences would be more viable financially.the film premiered at the 60th berlin international film festival as part of the competition screening on february 13, 2010. spanish distributor manga films distributed the film in spain after winning a bidding war that reportedly reached the $6 million to $8 million range.
