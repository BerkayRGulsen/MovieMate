good news  and summer stock were also originally planned to become part of the backyard musical series. summer stock was released three years later.


== plot ==
the film is set in 1927 at fictional tait college, where football is all the rage ("tait song"/"good news").
tait's football star tommy marlowe (peter lawford) is a prime catch for the college girls. tommy tells his friend and non-playing teammate bobby turner (mcdonald) that the trick to attracting girls is to show no interest ("be a ladies' man").
new student pat mcclellan (marshall) resists his advances, cutting tommy down to size at a party ("lucky in love"). pat insults tommy in french, so tommy enlists part-time school librarian connie lane (june allyson) to help him study the language ("the french lesson"). he gradually falls for connie, who comes from a poor background, which does not bother her ("the best things in life are free"). meanwhile, babe doolittle (mccracken) is seeking to leave a relationship with jealous football player beef (tindall) so she can get involved with bobby turner.
at a local soda shop, babe advises pat not to lose her temper ("pass the peace pipe"). tommy's newly learned french fails to impress pat and he leaves dejectedly. babe, concerned that tommy's frame of mind will cause him to lose the big game, revives pat's interest by (untruthfully) telling her tommy comes from a wealthy family. connie grows attracted to tommy. tommy asks connie to the prom, but reneges when pat shows interest. connie is heartbroken ("just imagine"). tommy is failing french and begs for help from a reluctant connie - he belatedly realizes his true feelings for her although pat has pressured him into proposing.
in the end, tait wins the big game, tommy pairs off with connie, beef pairs off with pat, and babe pairs off with bobby turner. the college bursts out into song in a production number ("varsity drag").
