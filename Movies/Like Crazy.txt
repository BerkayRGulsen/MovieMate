=== development ===
drake doremus was inspired to make like crazy by the end of his eight-year long-distance relationship with desiree pappenscheller, who lived in london while doremus lived in los angeles. many elements of the film resemble their real-life relationship, such as frequent travelling between los angeles and london, trouble with american immigration laws, a brief marriage, a trip to santa catalina island (where jacob takes anna in the early stages of their relationship), and the gift of a bracelet (in the film, a bracelet is given to anna by jacob). the story was co-written by ben york jones, who had also been involved in long-distance relationships. together, they assembled a 50-page outline of the film which read more like a short story than a traditional screenplay. the outline included backstory, plot points, specific scene objectives, themes and emotional moments, but had minimal dialogue.anton yelchin was doremus's first choice to play jacob, based on yelchin's previous work, and was cast almost immediately after meeting doremus to discuss the role. after auditioning a number of actresses from los angeles and london to play anna, doremus talked to english actress felicity jones over the phone and asked her to tape rough versions of two scenes from the film. he was so impressed with her rendition of the film's final scenein which anna and jacob stand silently in a showerthat he decided to cast her. after jones arrived in los angeles, she and yelchin began an intensive week-long rehearsal before filming began. yelchin and jones met in a mexican restaurant to get to know one another and, during the week prior to shooting, spent "all day and often all night" discussing anna and jacob's relationship with each other and doremus.


=== filming ===
like crazy was filmed over four weeksthe first three in los angeles and the last in london. the production budget was $250,000, which included the cost of airfares for the cast and crew. the film was shot on a canon eos 7d still camera with cinema lenses, mounted on a rig constructed by cinematographer john guleserian. he chose the 7d for its portability and the ease it provided for shooting improvised scenes, where he found other cameras too cumbersome. guleserian said that many of the film's scenes were shot "really far away from our characters [followed by] really tight close ups" due to the technological limitations of the camera, but he noted that this added to the tone of the film.only a small number of crew members were employed to maintain the sense of intimacy that doremus wanted on set. at its largest, the crew consisted of around 20 people, while some scenes were shot with as few as three crew members, such as a scene on a santa monica beach where only doremus, guleserian and a boom operator were present in addition to the actors. doremus would often ask members of the crew to leave when filming intimate scenes between jones and yelchin so that the two actors would feel more comfortable. these scenes would be shot in improvised takes of up to 30 minutes in length, with doremus providing only occasional direction. the film's dialogue was almost entirely improvised by the actors, whose lines doremus believed would come about "by virtue of being fully involved in the character and the moment".


=== music ===
the film's original score was composed by pianist dustin o'halloran. other music used in the film included songs by paul simon, m83, stars, the mary onettes and figurine. doremus listened to several of these artists as he developed the story; he said that their songs "became the fabric of the film". he assembled a similar set of songs on a cd which he gave to the cast and crew to listen to throughout production.an official soundtrack, titled like crazy: music from the motion picture, was released on cd and in digital format in conjunction with the film's release. the track listing is as follows:
