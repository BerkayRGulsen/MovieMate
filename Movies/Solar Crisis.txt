== production ==
solar crisis began shooting in november 1989 with an announced budget of $30 million.  nippon steel, one of the investors, announced a japanese theme park based on the film.  scientist richard j. terrile served as a technical advisor for the film.  he at first tried to convince the filmmakers to avoid sending a crew to the sun, calling it unscientific.  when it was explained to him that audience would demand such a plot point regardless of scientific accuracy, terrile said he realized his job was to make impossible situations sound more plausible.  tv guide quoted the final budget as $43 million.  the film opened in japan in 1990.  when it underperformed, the producers extensively recut and reshot scenes to secure an american distributor.  sarafian had his name removed from the credits and replaced with the director's guild of america alias "alan smithee".  sarafian's son, tedi, who performed rewrites, was credited as "crispan bolt". producers edlund and nelson also brought in rene balcer to do uncredited rewrites.


== reception ==
tv guide rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "enjoy its awesome visuals or scorn its slipshod execution, solar crisis amounts to one small step for cinema, one giant leap for alan smithee."
