== reception ==
bosley crowther of the new york times said, "not that money lacks advantages, and not that the basic idea behind this silly little picture couldn't be brightly kicked around. but that hasn't been done in the hodge-podge of farcical situations here contrived, nor in the witless and unbeguiling acting of the juvenile principals. joyce reynolds is dewishly sophomoric as the girl who thinks money is a curse (even after she is given $1,000,000 by a dying millionaire) and robert hutton is merely collar-addled as her contrary-minded spouse. against such childish opposition, cecil kellaway and ernest truex, two old hands at ripping up farce scripts and scenery, pretty well have their reckless ways. some of their clowning is enlivening but for the most part it is forced and dull. the warners will have to do much better in arguing for money than this."
