michelle orange of sbs gave the film three stars out of five. she observed that the "over-reliance on score sets up an avoidant rhythm that begins to feel like a lack of narrative confidence." however she also points out that "fletchers atmospheric approach is not without moments of emotional power, and the raw, unyielding landscapes of northwestern australia are framed to resonant effect."
