cindy discovers she is pregnant and tells dean he is unlikely to be the father. she opts for an abortion but cancels the procedure at the last moment. dean comforts and reassures her that he wants to raise the child together. cindy and dean get married.
five years later, the couple lives in rural pennsylvania with their daughter, frankie. cindy is now a nurse at a clinic where her boss, dr. feinberg, had just offered her to join him at a different clinic in the near future. meanwhile, dean paints houses for a living while struggling with alcohol. one day, their missing family dog is found dead by the side of the road due to cindy having left a gate unlocked, which further strains the couple's marriage. despite cindy's reluctance, dean insists on a romantic getaway at a motel to relax and attempt to rekindle their relationship. stopping by a liquor store, cindy has an awkward encounter when running into bobby, which causes an ensuing argument in the car between her and dean.
at the motel, dean repeatedly tries to seduce cindy but she rebuffs him. frustrated with dean's lack of ambition, she questions him during dinner which leads to another argument. the two make up and get drunk but cindy is displeased when dean asks if she wants to have another child with him. they start fighting and she locks him outside the bedroom. early in the morning, cindy is called in for work. she takes the car and leaves a note for dean. at the clinic, dr. feinberg recommends that cindy get an apartment instead of moving her family, suggesting that they could keep each other company during the weekdays if she's lonely. visibly upset, cindy voices that she thought he offered the position because of her qualifications.
back at the motel, an annoyed dean finds the note and shows up drunk at the clinic where he has a heated argument with cindy. dean punches dr. feinberg, who fires cindy and kicks them out. while leaving the clinic, cindy demands a divorce. at her parents house, dean tries to persuade cindy to give the marriage another chance for the sake of frankie. cindy says she'd rather not have frankie grow up with parents who despise each other.

== production ==
williams was 21 when she received the script in 2002 and gosling committed to the production four years later, but filming did not begin until 2009, when williams was 28 (as was gosling), owing to cianfrance's inability to find financing. the director was also unable to film the "young" and "older" scenes several years apart as he had hoped, again due to lack of money. the film was to be shot in california but production was moved to brooklyn, new york and honesdale, pennsylvania. williams wanted to stay close to her brooklyn home to take care of her daughter, matilda (after the passing of heath ledger the year prior), so the director chose honesdale due to its proximity to brooklyn.

gosling and williams improvised dialogue; the scene in which their characters wander through new york together was unscripted, for example; the actorswho had both appeared in the united states of leland (2003) but had not shared scenesgot to know each other during its filming. before filming the marriage dissolution between the main characters, gosling and williams prepared by renting a home, bringing their own clothing and belongings, buying groceries with a budget based on their characters' incomes, filming home movies and taking a family portrait at a local sears with the actress who played their daughter, and staging out arguments. cianfrance visited the actors and assisted them in building tension while remaining in character: "one night he told gosling to go into williams' bedroom and try to make love to her. gosling, soundly rejected, ended up sleeping on the couch."the film was shot in super 16mm and red one. the former was used for the pre-marriage scenes and the latter was used for the post-marriage scenes.
andrij parekh used only one professional light in the filming of the outside scenes, otherwise using only practical lights for the inside scenes.
while on the hollywood reporter director's roundtable, cianfrance said that he had given up his entire director's fee to help fund the film: "i mean, it came down to we were exactly my fee short. they paid me and i just paid it back. so i still have to pay taxes on it, you know. so i actually had to pay to make the movie."
