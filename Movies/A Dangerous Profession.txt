=== box office ===

=== critical ===
the new york times gave the film a mixed review, and wrote, "laconic and familiarly tough are the words for raft's performance as the torch-bearing bail bonds-man. ella raines is decorative if little else as the object of his affections; pat o'brien contributes a standard portrayal as his hard business partner; james backus is professional as a tenacious detective lieutenant and bill williams is adequate in the brief role of the embezzler. a dangerous profession, in short, proves that the bail-bond business can be dangerous and that it also can be the basis for an exceedingly ordinary adventure."
