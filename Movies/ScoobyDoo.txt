in the resort's ghost ride, the gang splits up to look for clues. fred and velma come across a school designed to educate inhuman creatures about human culture, while daphne discovers a pyramid-shaped artifact called the daemon ritus. the island's demons kidnap and possess fred, velma, mondavarious and other tourists, and zarkos possesses daphne and steals the daemon ritus. shaggy, in a underground chamber, find a vat of protoplasm containing the souls of those possessed, and he frees those of his friends. velma discovers that sunlight destroys the demons. they come across the voodoo priest, who explains that the demons, led by mondavarious, will rule the world for the next ten thousand years if a pure soul is offered as a sacrifice during their ritual. shaggy realizes that the pure soul is scooby, who unwittingly accepts to be the sacrifice.
the gang plots to trap the demon cult, but it fails and only daphne escapes capture. mondavarious extracts scooby's soul using the daemon ritus, but shaggy breaks free and pushes mondavarious aside, causing scooby's soul to be released. fred and velma discover mondavarious is actually a robot controlled by scooby's estranged nephew scrappy-doo, who was abandoned by the gang years ago after his power-hungry nature got out of control. 
using the tourists' souls, scrappy transforms into a monster and tries to kill the gang. daphne is attacked and captured by zarkos again, but defeats him by kicking him into the ritual chamber, where he knocks over the vat and sets the souls free to return to their bodies. daphne kills the demons by reflecting sunlight via a skull-shaped disco ball. shaggy rips the daemon ritus from scrappy's body to free the souls and finds the real mondavarious imprisoned in a small underground cell, having been captured by scrappy so he could pose as his double. scrappy, n'goo, zarkos, and their minions are arrested while the reunited gang promises to continue solving mysteries together.
