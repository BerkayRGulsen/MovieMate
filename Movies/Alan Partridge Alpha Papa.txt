== production ==
alan partridge, played by steve coogan, was created for the 1991 bbc radio 4 comedy programme on the hour, a spoof of british current affairs broadcasting. the character went on to appear in a series of radio and television productions, including knowing me, knowing you and i'm alan partridge.
rumours of an alan partridge film began in august 2004, when a small piece appeared in the metro newspaper which claimed coogan had been given the green light from a us studio for a partridge film. coogan reportedly said: "it's always been my plan to make alan go global. it's what he lives for really, not just doing the show on radio norwich." in april 2005, coogan's production firm baby cow announced that an alan partridge movie was in the pipeline. it was later revealed the film would involve an al-qaeda siege, but due to the sensitivities of such a storyline after the july 2005 london bombings, the project was put on hold. playwright patrick marber, whose early collaborations with coogan included the day today and knowing me, knowing you... with alan partridge, had also been working on the script, while actress felicity montagu, who plays partridge's personal assistant lynn, also confirmed that there had been discussions about the film.
further details of the film were released in november 2007. the plot of the film involved alan partridge attempting another comeback from local radio, only to have his ambitions thwarted when middle eastern terrorists hijack the bbc offices. coogan had written some dialogue, but at the time he was uncertain of whether he wanted to revisit partridge. in 2010, armando iannucci confirmed that a film was definitely in the works, as well as announcing that the film would not be based on partridge travelling to the united states: "steve and i have agreed a story for the film. it's not alan goes to america." meanwhile, the character was revived for a web series mid morning matters with alan partridge, as well as two one-off specials produced for sky atlantic.in 2012, iannucci stated that the as-yet-untitled film was in pre-production and would be shooting later in the year for a 2013 uk release, and would be directed by declan lowney of father ted fame. the film is a co-production between baby cow productions, bbc films, the bfi film fund, and studiocanal. the film had a budget of 4 million. it was released in the uk by studiocanal. in march 2013, a teaser trailer for the film revealed the title to be alan partridge: alpha papa.
