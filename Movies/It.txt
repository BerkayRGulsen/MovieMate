== evaluation of the year ==
richard brody of the new yorker described 2015 as, "one of hollywoods worst years" but also stated that it was also "a terrific year for movies over all". he emphasized that, "the anticipated oscarizables have mainly ranged from the blandly enjoyable to the droningly disastrous. partly, the problem is merely one of scheduling: most of hollywoods inspired directors, the ones whose images have a natural musical sublimity and complexity, werent on call this year. my list reflects the unfortunate accident of a calendar year with no release by many of the best american directors working in or out of the hollywood system, such as martin scorsese, sofia coppola, wes anderson, miranda july, terrence malick, james gray, david fincher, steven soderbergh, and paul thomas anderson."
