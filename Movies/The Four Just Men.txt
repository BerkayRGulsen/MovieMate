== critical reception ==
the new york times reviewer wrote, "four just men, by edgar wallace, whatever it might have been, was probably not a work of literature, and therefore, on that charitable assumption, it is gently, rather than harshly, that one must deal with the british-made screen version, now on view at the globe theatre. like all pictures seeping over from england nowadays, it is more than a little infected with the virus propagandistus, but, over and above that common-carrier failing, it is a model of sheer incredibility crossed with what (carrying out the charity idea) we might designate as espionage melodrama". according to a writer for the radio times decades later "it defiantly suggests that britain could never fall under the sway of a dictator. but in all other respects it's a rollicking boys' own adventure, with some of the most fiendishly comic-book murders you will ever see... hugely entertaining sub-hitchcockian antics".
