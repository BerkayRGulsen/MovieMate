== plot ==
maanav (arunoday singh) is a struggling filmmaker who will not compromise on the script he has written. his girlfriend ruchi (shahana goswami), a successful film editor, arranges for him to meet film producer nitin (sushant singh). nitin likes the script but is not very sure of its box office potential. maanav then suggests a story from the panchtantra: a woman is caught red-handed with her lover by her husband and yet, she manages to wriggle out of it scot-free! nitin loves the story but finds it too short for a feature film. maanav then creates three more stories based on the same premise: in a way, the panchantra story travels in different versions to the modern times through the film. the four stories are woven together by a common story. mirch itself echoes this structure, with four stories mingling with the main narrative.
1st story.
kashi(rajpal yadav) is a craftsman in india in ancient time. he has a beautiful wife maya (raima sen) who loves him with passion. he receives an invitation from the king to work in the palace. he tells maya that it is a great opportunity because if the king likes his work, they can become rich. she is upset because she does not want to be alone, but kashi convinces her. in the afternoon kashi's friend teases him that his wife is too pretty for him to handle and she will definitely call in another man the moment kashi leaves for the city. kashi furiously dismisses it but gets suspicious. he hides near in his house to observe his wife. his friend comes home asking for kashi. maya says husband is not at home. the friend then asks for water, which maya passes to him(without opening the door), he tries to make advances towards her but she throws water on his face and he runs away.
kashi is happy that his wife is extremely faithful to him. he sneaks under the bed to surprise her. maya then enters the room with a hunky prince(arunoday singh). she suddenly realizes that her husband is hiding under the bed. she then fabricates a story of how she was told by the astrologer that her husband has bad luck on him and he shall die within a few days. to avoid this she must consummate with another man so that the bad luck is diverted towards the second man. the prince plays along saying that being a kshatriya he is born to protect others and he is "obligated to do his duty".
kashi now in dilemma, whether to stop them and bear the "bad luck" or helplessly have his wife make love to another man right on the bed he that he is hiding under.
2nd story
this story is set in medieval times in rajput kingdom. raja nirgun singh(prem chopra), at the ripe old age of 70, has a young wife lavni(konkana sen). lavni is not satisfied with this marriage and discusses this with her maid kesara(ila arun). kesara tells her that it is not uncommon for queens to ask for "services" from young and reliable subjects. lavni tells her that she likes chandresh(arunoday singh), who is one of the king's subjects and is a close friend of the king. kesara passes on the message to chandresh, who refuses it saying he cannot do this because this would be cheating on the king (he cannot tell the king about the queen's advances either as this would mean a death sentence). kesara tells him that he shall be rewarded very generously by the queen. on hearing this, chandresh says that he is agreeable but he has a few conditions and shall reveal them one by one. all these conditions require completion of seemingly impossible tasks which he puts forward just to deter the queen. but lavni completes these tasks(from plucking the tooth of the king to getting rid of the king's pet cat). he sees the queen's desperation and places one last task, that whatever "happens" must happen in front of the king. the queen says yes to this one as well.
one night the king and queen are sitting in the garden. chandresh walks in and the queen asks him to fetch fruit from the tree in the garden. chandresh climbs the tree and comes down asking for apology. the king asks him for what he saw, chandresh replied that he saw the king and queen in sexual embrace. the queen rejects that claim angrily, saying that this is something that has never ever happened, leave alone now (humiliating the king in the process). chandresh says that, even then, his vision *can* still happen, if the tree is possessed by a spirit. lavni dismisses that as a fairy tale, and instigates the king to verify this for himself. the old king, now with mixed feelings of embarrassment and anger, climbs the tree. being old and frail, he climbs up with some difficulty and then gets stuck on top of the tree and can not easily come down. meanwhile, chandresh and lavni down below get into a sexual embrace. the king sees them in the act from up on the tree but is still unable to climb down the tree. when the king does eventually manage to come down, he sees the queen and chandresh are fully dressed and sitting normally as if nothing had happened. the king is convinced that the sexual embrace he saw was just an unreal vision and orders the tree to be cut down, declaring it possessed.

== reception ==
upon release, mirch received mixed reviews from film critics.
filmfare gave the movie a four star rating stating mirch is a good showcase for the yet undermined talent of its lead actors. while the women are on top, the movie is a little ho hum like missionary.popular film critics taran adarsh puts it this way in his review, "mirch has two stories in the first half (great) and two stories in the second (disappointing), while the fifth one, which binds all the earlier tales, is a downer as well. eventually, it falls short of expectations!" he added, "mirch blends the serious issue of gender equality with the comic flavour of the film well, at least in the first half. but it's the post-interval portions that act as a downer and in turn, makes this mirch not as spicy."rajeev masand of cnn ibn gave it a two and a half star rating explaining "a stronger male lead and some tighter editing might have turned this into a crackling film. as it stands now, it's as appetizing as a half-cooked meal!", and praising the performances by the lead actresses raima sen and konkona sen sharma as sexually liberated women.anupama chopra of ndtv, feels that the director has failed to depict the good theme well. " mirch is a sexy idea that doesnt quite come to fruition, she wrote. "despite some good moments and smart writing, mirch isn't the spicy romp it couldve been. im going with two and a half stars," she added.
