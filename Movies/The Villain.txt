== plot ==
a beautiful woman, "charming jones" (ann-margret), is being escorted across the west by a naive, slow-witted cowboy, "handsome stranger" (schwarzenegger), after claiming a large sum of money given to her by her father, parody jones (martin). however, bad guy avery simpson (elam), who delivered charming the money, decides he wants it for himself. he hires an old outlaw, "cactus jack" (douglas), to rob them when they leave town.
throughout the trip, charming makes advances toward handsome, all of which are met with indifference. meanwhile, cactus jack proceeds to lay trap after trap for the two, all of which backfire. jack's attempt to enlist the assistance of nervous elk (paul lynde), the chief of a local american indian tribe, also fails.
finally, jack confronts the couple openly, at which point charming gives up on romancing handsome and instead kisses jack, who proceeds to bounce around in red-hot elation.

most of the reviews of the film were negative. gene siskel of the chicago tribune gave the film one star, as did walter j. addiego of the san francisco examiner; siskel described the film as "a direct ripoff of tex avery's marvelous road runner cartoons", while addiego wrote that it contained "the sorriest collection of jokes in recent memory [] put together by a group who probably wouldn't make the grade in the mel brooks school of infantile humor." also giving the film one star was kathleen carroll, who, in the new york daily news, summarized it as "a hopelessly stupid western spoof about a hopelessly stupid gunfighter who learns his bad-guy tactics from studying a pulp novel titled "badmen of the west" and who invariably ends up being outsmarted by his horse." after the film premiered in los angeles, the los angeles times reviewer linda gross wrote: the attitude of the entire movie is like one condescending dirty joke with lines like "what do you do when you capture a white woman?" or "i want to molest your lady friend."
robert g. kane, who worked for several years as a writer for dean martin's "celebrity roast," wrote the slim screenplay, which is full of such innuendoes. the humor has a smirky quality. ann-margret spends the entire movie trying to seduce schwarzenegger, who keeps running off to gather firewood. it gets embarrassing.

"the villain" is directed by former stuntman hal needham ("smokey and the bandit" and "hooper"). needless to say, the stunts, coordinated by gary combs, are pretty good, but the characters are like cartoons and the broad, burlesque humor is too simple to spoof.
