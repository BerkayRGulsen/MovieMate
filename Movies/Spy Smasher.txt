alan armstrong (kane richmond) as the spy smasher is a costumed vigilante and freelance agent, not associated with the us government as the country has not yet joined its allies in world war ii. after discovering information about nazi activities in occupied france, he is captured and ordered to be executed. however, with the help of pierre durand (franco corsaro), he escapes back to the united states, meeting with his twin brother jack (kane richmond). jack is incorrectly recognized and attacked by a nazi agent on american soil. the agent works for a sabotage leader codenamed the mask (hans schumm), who operates a u-boat near the coast. eve corby (marguerite chapman) plays jack's fianc.
the mask's attacks on the united states begin with an attempt to flood the country with forged money and destroy the economy. when this is defeated, he continues with other attacks including destroying aircraft, oil and munitions intended for britain. constant defeats at the hands of spy smasher, with support from jack armstrong and admiral corby (sam flint), also leads the villain to take the fight back to the masked hero. in the end, the villain is killed aboard his own u-boat in a sea of flaming oil.

== cliffhangers ==
chapter 11 has what film historians harmon and glut consider to be the "most unique chapter ending of them all:" spy smasher is gunned down by enemy agents at point blank range and falls from the top of an office building to crash into the pavement below. in the resolution, the audience discover that jack, spy smasher's brother, has knocked him out and stolen his costume. the real spy smasher turns up too late to save his twin.  this is notable because in nearly every other chapter ending ever produced the person in danger manages to somehow survive.

tris coffin as drake, the mask's spearhead heavy. drake is a reporter working for the ocean-wide television network. one of his espionage techniques was to leave the camera rolling after an interview inside admiral corby's office or a report from a crime scene. the broadcast was then picked up by the mask in his submarine ("and presumably [by] the sets of any home viewer tuned into the proper channel").

== critical reception ==
in the opinion of film historians harmon and glut, spy smasher is the best serial in terms of special effects and stunts, and one of the best in general: "although lacking the beauty and imagination that appeals to a kind of racial unconscious in the jungian sense that is found in flash gordon...spy smasher emerges in a class by itself, the foremost cliffhanger example of a whole school of hollywood film-making in the 40s that gloried in matchless pure entertainment."  the script is consistently logical and well constructed with credible dialogue and good characterization. the cinematography is atmospheric and often artistic.  according to cline, spy smasher had a "very tight and fast-moving screenplay."  in the words of grant tracey, writing on the images journal website, spy smasher is "perhaps one of the best serials of all time because of its stunning cliffhangers and unique innovations to the serial form."
