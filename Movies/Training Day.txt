== plot ==
ambitious lapd officer jake hoyt is up for promotion and is assigned to detective alonzo harris, a highly-decorated narcotics officer, for a one-day evaluation. driving around in alonzo's monte carlo, they begin the day by catching some college kids buying cannabis. confiscating their drugs, alonzo puts them into a pipe and tells jake to smoke it. when jake refuses, alonzo threatens him at gunpoint, stating that refusing like this while on the streets would get him killed. jake smokes the pipe, and alonzo tells him that it was laced with pcp. after paying a visit to roger, an ex-cop turned drug dealer, jake notices a pair of addicts attempting to rape a teenage girl in an alley. jake intervenes while alonzo watches. after the girl leaves and alonzo scares the addicts off, jake finds the girl's wallet on the ground and retrieves it.
later, alonzo and jake apprehend a dealer named blue, finding crack rocks and a loaded handgun on him. rather than go to jail, blue informs on his employer kevin "sandman" miller, who is in prison. using a fake search warrant, alonzo steals $40,000 from sandman's home. at lunch, the two visit alonzo's mistress sara and their young son. alonzo then meets with a trio of corrupt high-ranking police officials he dubs as the "three wise men". aware that the russian mafia is hunting alonzo, they suggest that he skip town. alonzo insists he has control of the situation, and trades sandman's drug money for an arrest warrant.
using the warrant, alonzo, jake, and four other narcotics officers return to roger's house and seize $4 million from the premises, a quarter of which alonzo keeps. alonzo shoots and kills roger when jake refuses to do so, and stages the scene with his men to make the shooting justified. infuriated, jake gets into a mexican standoff with the corrupt officers; alonzo (having planned the day's events long in advance) threatens jake by reminding him of the lapd's routine blood test, which will identify the pcp-laced cannabis jake smoked earlier and end his career. alonzo promises to protect jake for his cooperation, and jake is forced to comply.
later that evening, alonzo drives jake to the home of a sureo gangster named "smiley" for an errand. jake reluctantly plays poker with smiley and his fellow gang members as he waits for alonzo. as they talk, smiley reveals alonzo's situation: by midnight tonight, alonzo must pay $1 million to the russians for killing one of their men in las vegas, or be killed himself. realizing that alonzo abandoned him and has paid smiley to kill him, jake attempts to flee but is beaten and dragged to the bathroom to be executed. before they can kill jake, a gang member searches him for money and finds the wallet of the teenage girl, who happens to be smiley's cousin. after calling his cousin and confirming how jake had saved her, smiley releases jake.
jake returns to sara's apartment to arrest alonzo, just as he is leaving to pay the russians with roger's money. a gunfight and chase ensue, and alonzo is eventually subdued on the street while the entire neighborhood (who despises alonzo) gathers to watch. alonzo offers money to whoever kills jake, but nobody is interested. jake then takes the stolen cash, intending to submit it as criminal evidence against alonzo. the neighborhood gang allows jake to leave as an infuriated alonzo watches. 
alonzo flees for his life to lax, but he is ambushed and killed by the russians. jake returns home as the press reports on alonzo's death.

=== development ===
although corruption in l.a.'s c.r.a.s.h. unit was yet to be exposed when training day was written, antoine fuqua has stated that the emergence of the rampart scandal in the late 1990s catalyzed the completion of the film. denzel washington also grew a beard in order to emulate the appearance of rafael prez, an lapd narcotics officer involved in multiple scandals. fuqua wanted washington's character to be seductive and part of a machine, and not just a random rogue cop. in washington's own words: "i think in some ways he's done his job too well. hes learned how to manipulate, how to push the line further and further, and, in the process, hes become more hard-core than some of the guys he's chasing."fuqua also saw ethan hawke's character as generally honorable but so driven by ambition that he was willing to compromise his principles, particularly when following the charming and persuasive example of washington's character. he has said that he fought with studio executives who wanted to cut the three wise men scene, thinking it slowed the film. he insisted that the wise men scene was pivotal in establishing that at least some of alonzo's illegal actions were sanctioned by his superiors who regarded unethical behavior as a necessary evil.fuqua wanted training day to look as authentic as possible, and he shot on location in some of the most infamous neighborhoods of los angeles. he even obtained permission to shoot in the imperial courts housing project, the first time l.a. street gangs had allowed film crew to be brought into that neighborhood. the crew also filmed in hoover block and baldwin village. parts of the film were shot on a dead end street called palmwood drive, where the black p. stones blood gang members were seen on the rooftops. cle shaheed sloan, the gang technical advisor of training day, managed to get on screen real-life gang members from rollin' 60 crips, pj watts crips, and b. p. stones (a bloods set). according to fuqua, the actors and crew ended up receiving a warm welcome from local residents. when he was unable to shoot a scene directly on location, he recreated the locations on sets.there were also two police officers on hand as technical advisors, michael patterson and paul lozada (the latter from the san francisco police department). washington, hawke and other cast members also met with undercover police officers, local drug dealers, and gang members to help them understand their roles better.
