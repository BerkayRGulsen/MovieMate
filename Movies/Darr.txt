=== critical response ===
slant magazine's film critic, glenn heath jr., liked the film writing, "mood dictates narrative in andre de toth's dark waters, a hallucinatory jigsaw puzzle set in the deep swamps of 1940s louisiana that becomes a perfect breeding ground for noirish shadows and deceptive wordplay ... dark waters ends with multiple dead bodies sinking into the bayou and leslie directly confronting what one character calls her "persuasion complex." the bravura finale through the oozing locale is a stunner, and despite some surface romance that feels a bit forced, the film stays true to its mystically dark mood, a slithering distant cousin to tourneur's i walked with a zombie.
