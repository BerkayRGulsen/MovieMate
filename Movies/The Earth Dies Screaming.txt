wheeler winston dixon wrote about the film's use of silence:

"... it's remarkable to note than [sic] in a 62 minute film, the first five to six minutes have conveyed fishers vision of the end of civilization entirely through a dispassionate series of images ... much of the film, involving the pursuit of the living by the dead, is done entirely through gesture...
writing in the zombie movie encyclopedia, academic peter dendle cited the film as "an obvious precursor to night of the living dead."
