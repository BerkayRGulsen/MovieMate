== reception ==
though produced in technicolor as an a production, aaron slick from punkin crick fared poorly at the box office and was relegated to b movie status.bosley crowther of the new york times wrote in his april 19, 1952 review: "claude binyon, who wrote and directed, must have done so in a stultifying trance; not a trace of his well-known wit or drollery is evident in this film. and the songs, which are woodenly delivered by miss shore, mr. young and robert merrill, who plays the city rascal, are hard to remember as far as the door."variety was lukewarm, reporting: "the bucolic humor presented is of a mild brand, the music score that has been added to the original play is fair, and while the performances are competent its chances in the general market are spotty."harrison's reports wrote that the film should give "... fairly good satisfaction to the general run of audiences, although it will probably find its best reception in the smaller towns and cities."john mccarten of the new yorker wrote: "every clich of musical barnyard drama is included here, and the song lyrics run to such idiocies as 'purt nigh but not plumb.' associated with mr. merrill in this hayshaking enterprise are alan young and dinah shore. they'll make you long for the streets outside."english film historian and critic leslie halliwell considered aaron slick from punkin crick to be "[h]omespun entertainment based on a staple success of the american provincial theatre, with pleasant songs added."
