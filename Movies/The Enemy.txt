== censorship concern ==
the motion picture producers and distributors of america, formed by the film industry in 1922, regulated the content of films through a list of subjects that were to be avoided. while lillian gish portrayed a prostitute in the enemy, this was acceptable as prostitution was not explicitly barred so long as it was not forced (i.e., white slavery) and aspects of her work were not shown in the film.
