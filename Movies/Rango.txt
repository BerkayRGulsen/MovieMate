== plot ==
an anthropomorphic pet chameleon becomes stranded in the mojave desert in california after his terrarium falls from his owners' car due to an accident. on the road, he meets the cause of the accident, a nine-banded armadillo named roadkill who is seeking the mystical "spirit of the west" by trying to get to "the other side" (metaphor for the afterlife). after almost being killed by passing cars while trying to help roadkill, he survives and ends up near roadkill again. after telling him that he is looking for water, roadkill tells him of a western town called "dirt", an old west town that possibly has water, but unfortunately, it is far out into the desert. seeing no other options, he walks out into the desert. while wandering the desert, he narrowly avoids being eaten by a vicious red-tailed hawk before meeting beans, a desert iguana, who takes him to dirt, which is populated by other anthropomorphic animals, where it is said that water comes in through a mysterious rite on wednesdays.
asked about his identity, the chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named rango, lying about killing a feared gang, the jenkins brothers, using only one bullet. he quickly runs afoul of gila monster outlaw bad bill but avoids a shootout when bill is scared off by the hawk's return. rango is chased by the hawk and is almost killed while trying to use some evasive maneuvers, which the townspeople believe that he is chasing the hawk while they hide out in the saloon. he runs until he reaches an empty water tower, but the hawk grabs the piece of licorice that rango had attached to him. he accidentally knocks down the water tower while trying to shoot off the piece of licorice, but the bullet goes through it and ricochets towards the tower, which crushes the hawk to death. for defeating it, the town's mayor, an elderly desert tortoise, appoints rango as the town's new sheriff. meanwhile, the townsfolk worry that with the hawk dead, the gunslinger rattlesnake jake, who fears the hawk, will return.
after discovering that dirt is in the midst of a drought and its only water supply, which is stored in the town bank inside a water cooler bottle, to be near empty, a skeptical beans demands that rango investigates where the water has gone. that night, rango inadvertently assists a trio of bank robbers, led by a mole named balthazar, mistaking them for prospectors. the townsfolk find the bank's bottle stolen the next morning, so rango organizes a posse. during the search, they find the banker, mr. merrimack, to be dead in the middle of the desert, but oddly enough, the cause of his death was from drowning. the posse tracks the robbers to their hideout in a canyon, where they fight balthazar's bat-riding clan over the stolen water bottle before discovering it to be empty. the robbers profess that they found it empty, but the posse still takes them into custody.
rango questions the mayor about his buying of the land around dirt, but the mayor denies any wrongdoing and shows rango that he is building a modern city with the purchased land. the mayor then summons rattlesnake jake, who runs rango out of town after forcing him to admit that he lied to the townsfolk. rango returns to the road where he fell from out of the car, crosses to the other side amidst the heavy traffic, and passes out, taken away by a multitude of pill bugs. waking up the next morning, rango meets the spirit of the west, appearing as an elderly man with no name. after telling him what he did to the citizens of dirt, the spirit tells rango that he must go back and set things right, telling him that "no man can walk out on his own story".
with the aid of roadkill and mystical moving yuccas, rango discovers an emergency shut-off valve in a water pipeline to las vegas, which the mayor has been manipulating to cause the water shortage so he could buy the land for himself. rango returns to dirt to challenge jake to a duel, a diversion so the yuccas can turn the pipeline's valve to bring the water back to town. rango then holds jake at gunpoint and makes his resolve clear. the mayor, however, forces rango to surrender by threatening beans' life and locks them inside the bank's vault to be drowned. he then tries to shoot jake with rango's gun, intending to kill him along with the rest of the old west, but rango has taken the gun's only bullet, which he uses to shatter the vault's glass door, freeing himself and beans. impressed, jake salutes rango for his heroic deed and drags the mayor with him out of town as his captive for double-crossing him. the citizens of dirt soon celebrate the return of the water and recognize rango as their true hero.
in the extended version, rango leaves town to perform a speech on a cliff in the evening sun, but as he refers to himself as the true spirit of the west, his steed bucks him off, which then, he says that he is going to take it from the top.


== voice cast ==


== production ==
during production, the actors and actresses received costumes and sets in order to "give them the feel of the wild west"; star johnny depp had 20 days in which to voice rango; and the filmmakers scheduled the supporting actors to interact with him. verbinski said his attempt with rango was to do a "small" film after the first three large-scale pirates of the caribbean movies, but that he underestimated how painstaking and time-consuming animated filmmaking is.the film contains a number of references to movie westerns and other films, including the shakiest gun in the west, a fistful of dollars, chinatown, the good, the bad and the ugly, once upon a time in the west, cat ballou, raising arizona and fear and loathing in las vegas; as well as references to earlier ilm work including the dogfight in the death star trench in star wars episode iv: a new hope. verbinski has also cited el topo as an influence on the film.in a discussion about the nature of contemporary animated features, verbinski said in december 2011,

there are shackles with the budgets and the profit margins. you want to compete with what they're doing at pixar and dreamworks. there's a price tag with that just in terms of achieving that quality level. what happened to the ralph bakshis of the world? we're all sitting here talking about family entertainment. does animation have to be family entertainment? i think at that cost, yes. there's the bull's-eye you have to hit, but when you miss it by a little bit and you do something interesting, the bull's-eye is going to move. audiences want something new; they just can't articulate what.

[but] more like a succession of picturesque notions that might have flowed from dreamworks or pixar while their story departments were out to lunch."in one of the more negative reviews, michael phillips of the chicago tribune acknowledged its "considerable care and craft" but called it "completely soulless" and that watching it "with a big suburban preview audience was instructive. not much laughter. moans and sobs of pre-teen fright whenever rattlesnake jake slithered into view, threatening murder."
