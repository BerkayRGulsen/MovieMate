== plot ==
young mike wazowski aspires to become a scarer  a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children and harvests their screams for energy  after visiting monsters, inc., monstropolis' most profitable scaring company, on a school field trip. eleven years later, mike is now a first-year scare major at monsters university, where he meets james p. "sulley" sullivan.
as the semester progresses, an intense rivalry forms between mike, who studies hard to improve himself, and sulley, who relies only on his natural talent and begins to falter. they both attempt to join a fraternity, but only sulley is accepted into roar omega roar (ror), the most prestigious fraternity on campus. at the semester's final exam, a fight between the two causes them to accidentally destroy dean abigail hardscrabble's cherished scream canister; hardscrabble fails them both on the spot, judging mike not scary and citing sulley's laziness, leading ror to promptly expel sulley.
wanting to prove himself, mike enters the university's "scare games" and makes a deal with hardscrabble: she will reinstate him and his team to the scare program if they win, but mike must leave the university if they lose. he joins a fraternity of misfits named oozma kappa (ok), but they are initially denied entry to the games for being one team member short, so sulley joins them upon seeing the competition as his only ticket to the scare program, to which mike reluctantly agrees.
ok loses in the first challenge, but are saved from elimination when another team is disqualified for cheating. ok improves gradually due to mike's training and intricate knowledge of scaring, enduring setbacks and humiliations by rival fraternities, and they advance through each following challenge until only they and ror remain. despite their progress, sulley does not believe that mike has the ability to ever be a true scarer after hardscrabble questions him. in the final round, they defeat ror with a surprising and decisive final scare by mike in the simulation bedroom. however, mike discovers that sulley had secretly rigged the machine, causing a heated fallout between the two, along with the other members, who were equally ashamed as they leave behind the undeserved trophy.
outraged at sulley's deception and still determined to prove that he can become a scarer, mike breaks into the school's lab where he enters the human world, finding himself at a summer camp in a cabin full of children. unable to scare any of them, he is forced to flee into the woods. sulley confesses to hardscrabble that he cheated just as mike's break-in is alerted. hardscrabble forbids anyone from going through the door, but sulley sneaks through to rescue mike. after reconciling, they try to return but are unable to exit after hardscrabble deactivates the door, waiting for the authorities to arrive.
pursued by camp rangers, mike realizes that the only way to escape is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. working together, sulley and mike terrify the camp rangers and generate an overwhelming amount of scream energy, returning to the lab as the device overloads and explodes in front of a surprised hardscrabble.
due to sulley's cheating and mike's break-in, both are expelled from the university, while the other members of ok are accepted into the scare program for the next semester as hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the games. hardscrabble wishes them good luck, stating that they were the first students to have surprised her. sometime later, the two get jobs at the mailroom of monsters, inc., eventually working their way up to join the scare team.

plans for a second monsters, inc. film existed since 2005. following disagreements between disney ceo michael eisner and pixar ceo steve jobs, disneywhich owned the rights to make sequels to all of pixar's films up to carsannounced that a sequel to monsters, inc. would be made by circle 7 animation (named after the street where its studio was located, and an often-used television station logo in the united states, designed in the early 1960s for the american broadcasting company's five owned-and-operated stations (all of which broadcast on vhf channel 7), which was also working on early drafts of toy story 3 & finding nemo 2. titled monsters, inc. 2: lost in scaradise, the film would have focused on mike and sulley visiting the human world to give boo a birthday present, only to find that she had moved. after getting trapped in the human world, mike and sulley would split up after disagreeing on what to do. screenwriters rob muir and bob hilgenberg were hired to write a script for the film, and storyboarded an early draft of it. disney's change of management in late 2005in which eisner was replaced by bob igerled to renewed negotiations with pixar, and in early 2006 disney announced it had purchased the studio. the disney-owned sequel rights were then transferred to pixar, leading to the cancellation of muir and hilgenberg's version of the film and the subsequent closure of circle 7.a pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010. the film was originally planned for release on november 16, 2012, but the release was moved up to november 2, 2012 to avoid competition with the twilight saga: breaking dawn  part 2. on march 29, 2011, it was confirmed that the film would be a prequel and the title monsters university was announced. on april 4, 2011, it was confirmed that the film will be released on june 21, 2013.

the feature was directed by dan scanlon and produced by kori rae. billy crystal, john goodman, steve buscemi, bob peterson, and john ratzenberger reprised their roles, and bonnie hunt voiced a new character. new voice cast included dave foley, sean hayes, julia sweeney, helen mirren, alfred molina, peter sohn, charlie day, joel murray, nathan fillion, aubrey plaza, tyler labine, john kransinski, bill hader, bobby moynihan, and beth behrs.the plot of monsters university details mike and sulley's first meeting, but this created a continuity error from the original film in which mike tells sulley "you've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade." director dan scanlon said he had a dilemma with this line during pre-production, but he believed it was best if mike and sulley meet in college because, "we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults. and we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are." he added, "it felt like the perfect place to do this, but we had that line. so we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. and we knew we didn't want to make monsters elementary." scanlon said during pre-production that, "pete docter, the original director, and john lasseter ... finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honoring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' so we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside." scanlon later retconned the line from the first film as "an old monster expression", saying, "thats what monsters always say to each other."


=== animation ===
monsters university is the first pixar film that used global illumination, a new lighting system introduced as part of the overhaul of the rendering system used since the first toy story film. in the planning stage of the film, director of photography, jean-claude kalache, asked "what if we made these lights just work?" before the new system, artists had to build reflections and shadows manually, which became increasingly complex as the models and the setups became more technologically advanced. the new lighting system uses path tracing, a technique that imitates the behaviour of the light in the real world; this automatized the process, delivered more realism, produced soft shadows, and let the artist spend more time on models and complex scenes  some of which contained thousands of light sources.for research, the filmmakers visited several colleges in the u.s., including harvard university, stanford university, uc berkeley, and the massachusetts institute of technology, observing college architecture, student life, greek organizations, and the teaching methods of professors and faculty. to research fraternity life, which is central to the film, many of the film's producers spent several weeks at a fraternity house. researchers also attended a "bonfire rally" at berkeley in anticipation of the big game, a rivalry football game between the university and stanford.

all ages.matt zoller seitz of chicago sun-times gave the film four stars out of four, saying it "is true to the spirit of [monsters, inc.] and matches its tone. but it never seems content to turn over old ground." trevor johnston of time out gave the film four stars out of five, writing "it has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. for a mere prequel, that's a result." steven rea of the philadelphia inquirer gave the film three stars out of four and said it "is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful." jake coyle of associated press gave the film three stars out of four, saying it "might not be as gifted as some of its other movies, but sometimes it's alright to be ok." peter travers of rolling stone gave the film three stars out of four, and said "it's all infectious fun, despite the lack of originality. in the art of tickling funny bones, crystal and goodman earn straight a's." richard corliss of time gave the film a positive review, saying "this minor film with major charms still deserves to have kids dragging their parents to the multiplex for one more peek at the monsters in the closet. with pixar, familiarity breeds content." bill goodykoontz of the arizona republic gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of five and said it is "one of those movies that has absolutely no reason to exist, but once you've seen it, you're kind of glad it does." alan scherstuhl of the village voice gave the film a positive review, saying "monsters university feels not like the work of artists eager to express something but like that of likable pros whose existence depends on getting a rise out the kids. it's like the scares sully and mike spring on those sleeping tykes: technically impressive but a job un-anchored to anything more meaningful."leonard maltin of indiewire praised the animation and art direction, but wrote that he wished "the movie was funnier and wasn't so plot-heavy" and that "pixar has raised the bar for animated features so high that when they turn out a film that's merely good, instead of great, they have only themselves to blame for causing critics to damn them with faint praise." michael phillips of chicago tribune gave the film two stars out of four, saying "monsters university, the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated 2001 pixar hit monsters, inc., is no better or worse than the average (and i mean average) time-filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses." todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter gave the film a negative review, saying that it "never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop in the manner of the best pixar stories. nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling." claudia puig of usa today gave the film three stars out of four, and said it "may not be as inventive as inc., but it's an amusing and amiable addition to pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories." michael o'sullivan of the washington post gave the film three stars out of four, saying "it may be children's terror that powers the movie's fictional universe, but it's the energy of its stars that lights up monsters university." chris nashawaty of entertainment weekly gave the film an a and said it "is exactly the rebound pixar needed after 2011's cars 2 left some wondering if the studio had lost its magic. the delightful story of when mike met sulley puts those concerns to rest." james berardinelli of reelviews gave the film three stars out of four and wrote "although it falls short of the best pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids."however, the film was not without its detractors. richard roeper gave the film a c+, saying "this is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets." stephen whitty of newark star-ledger gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and said "the artwork is accomplished, and intricate. the g-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. and there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references." manohla dargis of the new york times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote "both the originality and stirring emotional complexity of monsters, inc., with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing." ty burr of the boston globe gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said "this is not a bad movie, and to small children it will be a very good one, but it's closer to average than one would wish from the company that gave us up, wall-e, the incredibles, and the toy story series." rene rodriguez of miami herald gave the film two stars out of five and wrote that it "feels half-hearted and lazy, like they weren't even trying. at least show a little effort, guys."
