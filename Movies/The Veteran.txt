miller soon discovers that the security forces and the intelligence services are not quite what they seem. he uncovers a conspiracy the government is planning to set off a series of coordinated attacks to renew fear of terrorism to help them benefit from the god policy - guns, oil, and drugs. miller finds out that all his surveillance was simply to confirm the go ahead for the attacks. the government needs funding and the god policy had been instated for years. miller finds out that this links with the local gang terrorising his neighbourhood being linked with the terrorist cells.
