== reception ==
sify wrote " s.v.krishna reddy is back with yet another comedy that fails to impress. it is nothing but slapstick galore with mistaken identities and lot of double meaning dialogues." idlebrain.com gave 2.75 stars out of 5 and opined that first half of the film is mediocre and get a little better in the latter half.
