== production ==
the film marked the debut of mehmood ali's son manzoor ali, who did not act in any film after this. actors shahrukh khan and salman khan both have special appearances in the film, although they were seen in every trailer and promo of the film. they are both also shown together in all the posters of the film. shahrukh only has a 15-minute role at the beginning of the film and salman has a five-minute role halfway through the film. done as a favor to mehmood, salman and shah rukh khan's star power was relatively safe however the roles have been mocked. this movie also featured a song from famous singer and mehmood ali's elder son lucky ali "nasha nasha", which was his comeback song in bollywood as a playback singer after 22 years.
