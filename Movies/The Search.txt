the search is a 1948 swiss-american film directed by fred zinnemann which tells the story of a young auschwitz survivor and his mother who search for each other across post-world war ii europe. it stars montgomery clift, ivan jandl, jarmila novotn and aline macmahon.
many scenes were shot amidst the actual ruins of post-war german cities, namely ingolstadt, munich, nuremberg, and wrzburg. filming took place between june and november, 1947, initially on location in germany, before the cast and crew went to a film studio in zurich, switzerland, to film the interior scenes. although released in the united states in march, 1948, it was not released in britain until may 1950. its european premiere was held at the empire cinema, leicester square, london, england, on november 2, 1949, in aid of the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children. her majesty queen mary attended the premiere.
jandl was given a special juvenile academy award for his performance. by the time this was announced, in march 1949, he had returned to his home in prague, czechoslovakia, and the communists had taken over the government. they would not allow jandl to travel to the united states to collect the oscar and the golden globe he had also received for his performance, so they had to be taken to him. the film's director, fred zinnemann, accepted the oscar on jandl's behalf at the academy awards ceremony.


== plot ==
in allied-occupied germany trains transport homeless children (displaced persons or dps), under the care of mrs. murray and other united nations relief and rehabilitation administration (unrra) workers, to a transit camp where they are fed and protected. the next morning unrra officials begin the challenging process of identifying the children and reuniting them with their surviving family.
a young boy named karel responds "ich wei nicht" ("i don't know") to all questions. he grew up in a well-to-do czech family. the nazis deported his sister and their father, a physician, while karel and his mother were sent to a concentration camp. karel bears a tattoo, number a24328, and it is suggested that the a stands for auschwitz. they were separated and, after the war, karel survived by scavenging for food alongside other homeless children.
the next day the children are loaded into trucks and ambulances for transfer to other camps. the children in karel's group are terrified at first because the nazis often used ambulances to asphyxiate victims but eventually they enter the vehicle. during the trip the children panic at the smell of exhaust fumes. karel's friend raoul forces open the back door and children scatter in all directions. karel and raoul try to swim across a river to escape from unrra men. raoul drowns but karel hides in the reeds.
later karel encounters steve, an united states army engineer, who cares for him. because karel cannot recall his name steve calls him jim. steve teaches the boy english and begins the very long process to take the boy back with him to america.
when jim sees another young boy interacting with his mother, he starts remembering his own mother and the place where he last saw her, through a fence in the concentration camp. he runs away one evening thinking that the fence is nearby. jim finds a fence at a factory but cannot find his mother among the workers going home. steve eventually finds jim and tells him that his mother is dead. (steve has reason to believe she was gassed when she arrived at auschwitz.) he also lets jim know that he is trying to adopt him and take him to america to start a new life there.
as it turns out karel's mother, mrs. malik, is alive. in a parallel story she has been searching for her son. by chance she has been working for mrs. murray at the same unrra camp where her son was originally processed. after a while she resigns to resume her nearly hopeless search for karel. mrs. murray begs her to stay because she is so good with the children.
that same day steve takes the boy to the unrra camp before leaving for america. he hopes to send for the boy once the paperwork is completed. mrs. murray remembers the boy. suspecting that jim is karel, she hurries to the train station to bring mrs. malik back, but her train has already left. then she sees karel's mother walking toward her with the latest trainload of displaced children. she saw them being unloaded from a train, changed her mind and decided to stay.
at the unrra camp steve tells jim to join the crowd of new arrivals. mrs. malik tells the children to follow her. jim walks past neither recognizing the other at first. then mrs. malik swings around and calls, "karel!", the boy and his mother are reunited as mrs. murray and steve look on.
