"swing low, sweet chariot" is an african-american spiritual song and one of the best-known christian hymns. originating in early oral and musical african-american traditions, the date it was composed is unknown. performances by the hampton singers and the fisk jubilee singers brought the song to the attention of wider audiences in the late 19th century. j. b. t. marsh includes an early version of text and tune in his 1876 publication the story of the jubilee singers, with their songs. the earliest known recording of "swing low, sweet chariot" was taken in 1909, by the fisk jubilee singers of fisk university. 
the song uses the theme of death to remind the audience of the glory that awaits in heaven, when christians believe they will transcend the earthly world of suffering and come to rest in their final home. specifically, the text refers to the old testament account of the prophet elijah's ascent into heaven by chariot.the stylistic elements and thematic content are highly typical to those of other spirituals. the song is characterized by its use of repetition as a key poetic element, powerful imagery, personal rhetoric, and potentially coded lyrics. 
"swing low, sweet chariot" was traditionally performed as a call-and response tune. its free-form structure intentionally allows for improvisation and spur-of-the-moment changes made to bring the performers and audience to a state of ecstasy and connection with the holy spirit. the melody is pentatonic. 
in 2002, the us library of congress honored the song as one of 50 recordings chosen that year to be added to the national recording registry. it was also included in the list of songs of the century, by the recording industry association of america and the national endowment for the arts.


== history ==
"swing low, sweet chariot" was composed by wallis willis, a choctaw freedman in the old indian territory in what is now choctaw county, near the county seat of hugo, oklahoma sometime after 1865. he may have been inspired by the sight of the red river, by which he was toiling, which reminded him of the jordan river and of the prophet [[elijah] being taken to heaven by a chariot (2 kings 2:11).  some sources claim that this song and "steal away" (also sung by willis) had lyrics that referred to the underground railroad, the freedom movement that helped black people escape from southern slavery to the north and canada.
alexander reid, a minister at the old spencer academy, a choctaw boarding school, heard willis singing these two songs and transcribed the words and melodies. he sent the music to the jubilee singers of fisk university in nashville, tennessee. the jubilee singers popularized the songs during a tour of the united states and europe.in 1939, nazi germany's reich music examination office added the song to a listing of "undesired and harmful" musical works.the song enjoyed a resurgence during the 1960s civil rights struggle and the folk revival; it was performed by a number of artists. perhaps the most famous performance during this period was that by joan baez during the legendary 1969 woodstock festival.
oklahoma state senator judy eason mcintyre from tulsa proposed a bill nominating "swing low, sweet chariot" as the oklahoma state official gospel song in 2011.  the bill was co-sponsored by the oklahoma state black congressional caucus.  oklahoma governor mary fallin signed the bill into law on may 5, 2011, at a ceremony at the oklahoma cowboy hall of fame; making the song the official oklahoma state gospel song.


== lyrics ==
refrain:
swing low, sweet chariot,
coming for to carry me home.
swing low, sweet chariot,
coming for to carry me home.

i looked over jordan, and what did i see,
coming for to carry me home.
a band of angels coming after me,
coming for to carry me home. oh, [refrain]

if you get there before i do,
coming for to carry me home.
tell all my friends i'm coming too,
coming for to carry me home. oh, [refrain]

the brightest day that ever i saw
coming for to carry me home.
when jesus washed my sins away,
coming for to carry me home. oh, [refrain]

i'm sometimes up and sometimes down,
coming for to carry me home.
but still my soul feels heavenly 
bound,
coming for to carry me home. oh, [refrain]


== content and style ==
the content of the song is typical to the style of the spiritual in several ways: its use of imagery that provides a sense of immediacy to the historical and biblical past, the repetition of the key poetic element of the song (coming for to carry me home), and the alteration between the refrain and the stanzas throughout.  the song alternates between first person and second person pronouns, stressing the relationship between the performer, the listener, and the events unfolding in the song. by directly calling to the listener in the second stanza (if you get there before i do) the audience is transformed into a creative device that serves to heighten the emotional urgency of the tune.the song was originally intended to be sung in a call-and-response, a format that draws from the heritage of african styles of music and is widely used in african-american churches today. a leader sings the differentiated lines, and the congregation replies coming for to carry me home after each. this style of performing the spiritual can be heard in the existing recordings of the fisk jubilee singers performing the tune. this call-and-response performance style is the most common form of spiritual. the simple, repetitive nature of the song, along with the fact that it was commonly performed without instrumental accompaniment, meant that spontaneous shifts in tempo, pitch, and emphasis were commonly made, leading the song in new and exciting directions intended to unify congregants with the holy spirit.like other spirituals, swing low sweet chariot has been thought to contain coded meanings not immediately apparent to all listeners. american historian charshee charlotte lawrence mcintyre argues that many spirituals make use of metonymic devices, or metaphors that have encoded meanings. she claims that throughout many traditional spirituals several recurring figures always carry a metonymic double meaning. these double meanings allowed enslaved people to safely communicate messages of hope, freedom, and specific plans for escape to one another under the watchful gaze of their captors. the double meanings encoded in swing low, sweet chariot are believed to be the jordan river as representative of the first step to freedom from slavery, home as africa, and jesus as anyone who helps bring the enslaved to freedom. however, a definitive categorization of any such figures is impossible to make.

== use in rugby union ==
"swing low, sweet chariot" has been sung by rugby players and fans for some decades, and there are associated gestures, sometimes used in a drinking game, which requires those who wrongly perform the gestures to buy a round of drinks. folk singer joe stead claimed he introduced it to the rugby fraternity as early as 1960 after hearing it from civil rights activist paul robeson. an article published in tatler in 1966 described a "tradition" at the west park bar at twickenham of patrons singing the song whilst swaying as one, shoulder-to-shoulder. it became associated with the english national side, in particular, in 1988.


=== first documented singing at twickenham (1987) ===
the world rugby museum in 2020 unearthed archive footage of swing low being sung at twickenham when martin offiah (nicknamed "chariots" as a play-on-words referencing the 1981 film chariots of fire), played in the 1987 middlesex sevens tournament. the curator of the museum believes the crowd at twickenham would already have known swing low because it had been sung in rugby clubs since the 1960s, with rude gestures illustrating the words.


=== first documented singing at an england international match (1988) ===
coming into the last match of the 1988 season, against ireland at twickenham, england had lost 15 of their previous 23 matches in the five nations championship. the twickenham crowd had only seen one solitary england try in the previous two years and at half time against ireland they were 03 down. however, during the second half england scored six tries to give them a 353 win. the official account of this occasion from england rugby is that a group of fans from market bosworth rugby club in the west stand started singing the song before it was taken up by the rest of the crowd. another account states that a group of boys from douai school were the ones in the crowd to begin singing the song before it was taken up by other fans. the song is still regularly sung at matches by english supporters.


=== 2020 review ===
in 2020 the rugby football union, in response to the increased interest in the black lives matter movement after the killing of george floyd, said it was "reviewing" fans' use of the song. former rugby player brian moore and prince harry both argued that the song should no longer be sung in rugby contexts. former barbarian and rugby league hall of fame player martin offiah shortly afterwards said that he thought the song should be retained as an opportunity to educate england's and other nationalities' rugby fans about racial discrimination and black history. former england player maggie alphonsi said  "i think it's good the rfu are having a review, but i don't agree with it being banned". prime minister boris johnson said that the song should not be banned as people should "focus less on the symbols of discrimination".
