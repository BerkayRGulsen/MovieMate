ravana (;sanskrit: , iast: rvaa, pronounced [ra]) was a demon king  of lanka and the chief antagonist in the hindu epic ramayana and its adaptations.in the ramayana, ravana is described to be the eldest son of sage vishrava and rakshasi kaikeshi. he abducted rama's wife sita and took her to his kingdom of lanka, where he held her as a prisoner in ashok vatika, and also expressed a desire to marry her. later, rama, with the support of vanara king sugriva and his army of vanars, attacked ravana in lanka. they killed ravana and rama rescued his beloved wife sita.ravana is widely considered to be a symbol of evil, but he also had many qualities that made him a learned scholar. he was well-versed in the six shastras and the four vedas.  ravana is considered to be the most revered devotee of shiva. images of ravana are seen associated with shiva at some places. he also appears in the buddhist mahayana text lakvatra stra, in buddhist ramayanas and jatakas, as well as in jain ramayanas. in some scriptures, he is depicted as one of vishnus cursed doorkeepers.


== etymology ==

the word rvaa (sanskrit: ) means "roaring" (active), the opposite of vairavaa, meaning "hear distinctly" (passive). both ravana and vairavaa, who is popularly known as kubera, are considered to be patronymics derived as "sons of vishrava".rvana was a title taken on later by dashnana, and it means "screamer" in sanskrit (ravana would sing hymns). further, roravana is sanskrit for "loud roaring." in abhinava gupta's krama shaiva scripture, ysm rvanam is used as an expression to mean people who are truly aware in terms of the materialism of their environment.
ravana has many other popular names, such as dasis ravana, dasis sakvithi maha ravana, dashaanan, ravula, lankeshwar, lankeshwaran, ravanasura, ravanaeshwaran, and eela vendhar.


== iconography ==
ravana is depicted and described as having ten heads, although sometimes he is shown with only nine heads, as he cut one off to convince shiva. he is described as a devout follower of shiva, a great scholar, a capable ruler and a maestro of the veena (pronounced veh-nah; a chordophone instrument). ravana is also depicted as the author of the ravana samhita, a book on hindu astrology, and the arka prakasham, a book on siddha medicine and treatment. ravana possessed a thorough knowledge of siddha and political science. he is said to have possessed the nectar of immortality, which was stored inside his belly, thanks to a celestial boon by brahma.


== life and legends ==


=== birth ===
ravana was born to great sage vishrava (or vesamuni), and his wife, the rakshasa princess kaikesi  in the treta yuga. people of bisrakh village in uttar pradesh claim that bisrakh was named after vishrava, and that ravana was born there. but according to hela historical sources and folklore, ravana was born in lanka, where he later became king.ravana's grandfather on his father's side, the sage pulastya, was one of the ten prajapatis or mind-born sons of brahma and one of the saptarishi (seven great sages rishi) in the first manvantara (age of manu). his maternal grandfather was sumali (or sumalaya); the king of the rakshasas and the son of sukesha. sumali had ten sons and four daughters. sumali wished kaikeshi to marry the most powerful being in the mortal world, so as to produce an exceptional heir. he rejected the kings of the world, as they were less powerful than him. kaikesi searched among the sages and finally chose vishrava, the father of kubera. ravana and his siblings were born to the couple. they completed their education from their father, with ravana being a great scholar of the vedas.


=== boon of ravana ===
ravana and his two brothers kumbhakarna  and vibhishana performed penances on mt gokarna for 11,000 years and won boons from brahma. ravana was blessed with a boon that would make him invincible to the creation of brahma, except for humans. he also received weapons, chariot as well as the ability to shapeshift from brahma. ravana later usurped lanka from his half-brother kubera and became the king of lanka. he appointed shukracharya as his priest and learned the arthashastra (science of politics) from him.


=== devotee of shiva ===

one of the most popular images of shiva is called as "ravananugraha" which was popular in gupta era which depicts ravan beneath mount kailasa playing the veena made out of his head and hand and strings made out of his tendons with shiva parvati sitting on top. according to scriptures, ravana once tried to lift mount kailash, but shiva pushed the mountain into place and trapped ravana beneath it. for a thousand years, the imprisoned ravana sang hymns (shiva tandava stotra) in praise of shiva, who finally blessed him and granted him an invincible sword and a powerful linga (shiva's an iconic symbol, atmalinga) to worship.


=== family ===

ravana's family are hardly mentioned outside the ramayana, which is viewed by some as being only the point of view of rama devotees. according to that:

ravana's granduncle was malyavan, who was against the war with rama and lakshmana. he also had another granduncle named mali who was killed by lord vishnu.
ravana's parents were sage vishrava (son of pulastya) and kaikesi (daughter of sumali and kethumathi). kaikesi had ten brothers, the famous generals in lankas army being dhumraksha, prahastha and akampana, which would effectively make them ravana's uncles and three aunties named kumbinashi, puspotkata, and raka. kaikesis father, sumali, was instrumental in making ravana the king of lanka by advising him to get boons from brahma, defeat kubera, and establish the rakshasa rule in the three worlds.
ravana had seven brothers and two sisters:kubera  the king of the north direction and the guardian of heavenly wealth. he was an older half-brother of ravana. kubera was born to vishrava's other wife, ilavida.
kumbhakarna  one of the most jovial demons in hindu mythology. when offered a boon by brahma, he was tricked into asking for eternal sleep. a horrified ravana, out of brotherly love, persuaded brahma to amend the boon. brahma mitigated the power of the boon by making kumbhakarna sleep for six months and being awake for the rest six months of a year (in some versions, he is awake for one day out of the year). during the war with rama, kumbhakarna was untimely awakened from his sleep. he tried to persuade ravana to open negotiations with rama and return sita to him. but he too failed to mend the ways of ravana. however, bound by a brother's duty, he fought on the side of ravana and was killed in the battlefield. before dying he met vibhishana and blessed him for following the path of righteousness.
vibhishana  a follower of rama and one of the most important characters in the ramayana. as a minister and brother of ravana, he spoke the truth without fear and advised ravana to return the kidnapped sita and uphold dharma. ravana not only rejected this sane advice but also banished him from his kingdom. vibhishana sought protection from rama, which was granted without hesitation.
khara  king of janasthan. he was a cousin of ravana and the son of kaikesi's sister raka.
dushana  viceroy of janasthan. cousin of ravana and twin brother of khara.
ahiravan  in krittivasi ramayan, ahiravan was king of the underworld ruled by the rakshasas by ravana and the demon king maya.
kumbhini  the older half-sister of ravana and the wife of the demon madhu, king of mathura. she was the mother of lavanasura.
sahastra ravana - he is mentioned in adbhuta ramayana as the elder brother of ravana, one thousand armed and thousand-headed, living on an island named pushkar, he was much more powerful than his younger brother. he is slain by sita who takes the form of mahakali to slay him.
shurpanakha  the sister of ravana. she was the ultimate root of the kidnapping of sita. she was the one who instigated her brothers to wage a war against rama.ravana was married to mandodari, the daughter of the celestial architect maya, dhanyamalini, and a third wife. his sons from his three wives were as follows:meghnaad (also known as indrajit because he defeated indra), the most powerful son of ravana. he was born to ravana's elder consort mandodari.

=== priestly ministers ===
ravana is said in some version to have had shukracharya, the priest of the asuras, as his minister, and in some versions brihaspati, the priest of the devas.
one of the most original, which is not found in earlier manuscripts, tells how ravana orders his court priest brhaspati (all the gods being his slaves) to read the chandi stava (mantras of chandi), that is, the devi mahatmya, in order to stave off defeat if he can recite it. according to the krttivasa text, ravana arranged for a peaceful yajna (sacrifice) and to start the recitation of chandi, brihaspati was invited. accordingly, brihaspati recited the same correctly.


== other legends ==


=== as vishnu's cursed doorkeeper ===
in the bhagavata purana, ravana and his brother, kumbhakarna, were said to be reincarnations of jaya, and vijaya, gatekeepers at vaikuntha, the abode of vishnu and were cursed to be born in earth for their insolence.
these gatekeepers refused entry to the sanatha kumara monks  who, because of their powers and austerity, appeared as young children. for their insolence, the monks cursed them to be expelled from vaikuntha and to be born on earth.
vishnu agreed that they should be punished. they were given two choices, that they could be born seven times as normal mortals and devotees of vishnu, or three times as powerful and strong people, but as enemies of vishnu. eager to be back with the lord, they choose the latter one. ravana and his brother kumbhakarna were born to fulfill the curse on the second birth as enemies of vishnu in the treta yuga. the curse of first birth was fulfilled by hiranyakashipu and his brother hiranyaksha in satya yuga when they were both vanquished by earlier avatars of vishnu (hiranyaksha by varaha and hiranyakashipu by narasimha) and the curse of third birth was fulfilled by dantavakra and shishupala in the dvapara yuga when they both were slain by krishna, the eighth avatar.
