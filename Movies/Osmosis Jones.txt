osmosis jones is a 2001 american live-action/animated buddy cop action comedy film directed by the farrelly brothers with animated scenes directed by piet kroon and tom sito. starring the voices of chris rock, laurence fishburne, david hyde pierce, brandy norwood and william shatner alongside live actors bill murray, molly shannon and chris elliott, the film centers on frank detorre (murray), a slovenly zookeeper; the live-action scenes are set outside frank's body while the animated scenes are set inside his body, which is portrayed as a city inhabited by anthropomorphic parameciums. in the animated sequences, white blood cell cop osmosis "ozzy" jones and cold pill drix attempt to prevent deadly virus thrax from killing frank within forty-eight hours.
produced by warner bros. feature animation and the farrelly brothers' conundrum entertainment, osmosis jones premiered at grauman's egyptian theatre on august 7, 2001 before being released in general theaters three days later on august 10, 2001. the film was met with mixed reviews from critics, who praised the animated scenes, the voice cast (particularly rock's, pierce's and fishburne's) and plot, but criticized the live-action portions and the overuse of gross-out humor. the film was also a box-office bomb, earning $14 million against a budget of $70 million, though it later sold well in home media. a spin-off animated television series titled ozzy & drix later ran on kids' wb from 2002 to 2004.


== plot ==
frank detorre is an unkempt and slovenly zookeeper at the sucat memorial zoo in rhode island. depressed by the loss of his wife years earlier, he copes by overeating and ignoring basic hygiene, much to the annoyance of his young daughter shane. inside his body, or "the city of frank" to its anthropromorphic inhabitant cells, white blood cell osmosis "ozzy" jones is an overzealous officer of the frank police department, the city's center for immune responses against bodily threats, who was demoted to patrol duty in the mouth after he induced frank to vomit against orders. this incident made frank the town's laughingstock, getting him fired from his previous job at a pea soup factory and also getting him banned from visiting shane's school due to a restraining order filed by her p.e. and science teacher, mrs. boyd.
two years later, facing a serious challenge to his reelection prospects, mayor phlegmming doubles down on his junk food policies, ignoring their effect on frank's health. this causes frank to eat a boiled egg covered in filth, allowing thrax, a deadly virus known as "the red death", to enter the throat. unwilling to admit responsibility, phlegmming instructs frank to take a cold pill through brain signals. the pill, drixenol "drix" koldreliff, proceeds to disinfect the throat, covering up evidence of thrax's arrival. to his displeasure, ozzy is assigned to assist the stoic and straight-laced drix in his investigation. meanwhile, thrax assumes leadership of a gang of sweat germs and launches an attack on the mucus dam in frank's nose, nearly killing drix before ozzy rescues him.
the two pay a visit to chill, a flu vaccine and one of ozzy's informants, who directs them to thrax's hideout in a germ-ridden nightclub in a large zit on frank's forehead. ozzy goes undercover and infiltrates thrax's gang, where he learns that thrax, wanting his own chapter in the medical history books, intends to masquerade as a common cold and use his knowledge of dna to kill frank in forty-eight hours. when ozzy is discovered, drix comes to his aid, causing a brawl which culminates in the zit being popped by a grenade. the pus lands on mrs. boyd's lip during a meeting with her and frank, ruining any chance for him to apologize. in response, phlegmming closes the investigation, has ozzy fired from the force and orders drix to leave.
unbeknownst to the duo, thrax has survived the zit's destruction and, after killing his remaining henchmen, launches a lone assault on the hypothalamus, where he steals a crucial nucleotide. he then abducts phlegmming's secretary, leah estrogen, and flees to the mouth to escape. his actions disable the body's ability to regulate temperature and a dangerous fever develops, causing mass panic to erupt in the city. as frank is taken to the hospital, ozzy, having discovered thrax's survival, convinces a dejected drix not to leave, and the two catch up to thrax and rescue leah. however, thrax uses pollen to induce frank to sneeze and blow him out of the mouth. drix shoots ozzy out of the mouth after thrax, and he and thrax both land on shane's cornea. as the two fight, they end up on one of shane's false eyelashes, where thrax appears to gain the upper hand and threatens to make shane his next victim. ozzy, however, has tricked thrax into getting his hand embedded in the lash, and escapes just as the lash falls into a beaker of rubbing alcohol, melting thrax.
as frank's temperature goes over 108 degrees, he goes into cardiac arrest. riding one of shane's tears as she mourns her father, ozzy falls back into frank's mouth with the stolen nucleotide, reviving him in time. ozzy is then reinstated into the police force as he begins a relationship with leah, and drix stays as ozzy's new partner. having narrowly cheated death, frank commits himself to living a healthier lifestyle with shane, which results in phlegmming being impeached from office and his opponent tom colonic winning by a landslide in the election. phlegmming is then reduced to janitorial duty in the bowels, where he accidentally ejects himself from frank's body by triggering his flatulence.

== production ==
osmosis jones went through development hell during production. the animated sequences, directed by tom sito and piet kroon, went into production as planned, but acquiring both a director and a star actor for the live-action sequences took a considerable amount of time, until bill murray was cast as the main character of frank, and peter and bobby farrelly stepped in to direct the live-action sequences. as part of their contract, the farrelly brothers are credited as the primary directors of the film, although they did no supervision of the animated portions of the film. will smith was interested in the part of ozzy, but in the end his schedule would not permit it.
osmosis jones was originally rated pg-13 by the mpaa for "crude language" and "bodily humor" in 2000. however, warner bros. edited the film to make it family-friendly; and in 2001 when it was released, the film was re-rated pg on appeal for "bodily humor".

the film received numerous annie award nominations including best animated feature (losing to shrek).
