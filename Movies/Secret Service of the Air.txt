== plot ==
an undercover secret service agent stumbles upon a smuggling ring illegally transporting mexicans into the united states by air. when he pulls a gun on the pilot on one such trip, the pilot sends the aircraft into a sudden climb, causing the agent to tumble back into the cabin; the pilot then pulls a lever which opens the cabin floor, sending the agent and six illegal aliens plummeting to their deaths.
the agent's boss, tom saxby (john litel), needs a pilot to infiltrate the smuggling ring. he turns to commercial airline and former military pilot "brass" bancroft (ronald reagan), who has applied to join the secret service.
arrested on a trumped-up charge of counterfeiting, brass is locked in a cell with gang member "ace" hamrick (bernard nedell). brass learns that the smugglers use the los angeles air taxi company, where he lands a job (after saxby has the regular pilot arrested). with his friend and radio operator, "gabby" watters (eddie foy jr.), brass convinces the ringleader, jim cameron (james stephenson), to let him take over the smuggling flights. he tricks cameron into entering the united states to be captured by the border patrol. after an air battle, brass turns the smugglers over to the authorities, and is greeted by his fiance, pamela schuyler (ila rhodes).

== reception ==
with secret service of the air becoming a minor "b" hit, it spawned a series with three more films rushed into completion over the next 15 months. frank s. nugent of the new york times dismissed the film as "... considerable melodramatic ado about nothing, since the new film is an uninspired reworking of the old story about smuggling aliens ..."
