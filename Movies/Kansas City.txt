== reception ==
kansas city received mixed to positive reviews from critics, as it holds a 62% rating on rotten tomatoes based on 37 reviews. roger ebert gave it three stars for altman's "originality and invention", saying the story is "fairly thin" but "altman gathered some of the best living jazz musicians, put them on a set representing the hey hey club, and asked them to play period material in the style of the kansas city jazz giants (count basie, coleman hawkins, jay mcshann, lester young, etc.). he filmed their work in a concert documentary style, and intercuts it". he praised the period recreation of colors and looks of the clothes, cars, and advertising and was reminded of altman's other 1930s gangster movie, thieves like us (1974).
harry belafonte won the new york film critics award for best supporting actor.
