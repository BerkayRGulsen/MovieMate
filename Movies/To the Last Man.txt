== reception ==
in his book, the hollywood western: ninety years of cowboys and indians, train robbers, sheriffs and gunslingers, film historian william k. everson discusses the film and notes that the zane grey series was "uniformly good."  he also writes: to the last man was almost a model of its kind, an exceptionally strong story of feuding families in the post-civil war era, with a cast worthy of an "a" feature, excellent direction by henry hathaway, and an unusual climactic fight between the villain (jack larue) and the heroine (esther ralston, in an exceptionally appealing performance).
