== production ==
in 1994, broderick said of the project, "the obvious way to structure a film about feynman would be to open with the challenger disaster: the crazy old genius comes along and figures everything out, then he drifts into a reverie along the lines of 'a long time ago i met a girl.. . .' we didn't do that, because we want this to be an intimate movie and thought focusing on one period of his life that includes the invention of the bomb and the death of his first wife was enough."broderick later said in 1997, "it was a difficult job and took four years from start to finish."
