a boy obsessed with football finds his life changing dramatically once he adds a little samba. danny (ash) plays on the football team at the all-boys catholic school he attends in belfast. danny's three best friends, who also play on the team, all have different ambitions for their lives. mickey (maclean stewart) wants to be a fashion designer so he can get rich and date supermodels. gary (russell smith) wants to become a magician so he can get rich and meet beautiful women (and presumably saw them in half). and spike (joe rea) likes to beat people up, so he wants to become a mercenary and do it for a living. but danny dreams of making football his life.
the players danny most admires are south americans, such as pele and carlos riga, who he feels have a special rhythm and flexibility. wanting to add some of these qualities to his own game, danny has an idea: he'll take samba lessons, in the hope that dancing like a south american will help him play like a south american. to the surprise of himself and his friends, danny turns out to be a pretty good latin dancer and finds himself smitten with a student in his dance class, lucy (russell). however, lucy happens to have a boyfriend, who is a fierce competitor on one of danny's rival teams. the film also stars brian flanagan who plays an inspiring cameo role along with members of celbridge town football club.
