an american artist living a bohemian existence in paris, tom warshaw (david duchovny) is trying to make sense of his troubled adult life by reflecting upon his extraordinary childhood.

following the romantic advice offered by lady (erykah badu)  incarcerated in the infamous new york women's house of detention for shadowy reasons  tommy experiences his first taste of love. yet when an unexpected tragedy radically alters his world, tommy must take a life-defining choice  one that will compel the adult tom, thirty years later, to confront his unfinished past.

house of d was given a score of 10% on rotten tomatoes with a consensus calling it "a sincere but inept coming of age story." box office mojo gives the reviews a c+. many critics attribute the poor reception to the fact that duchovny wrote and directed the movie, which gave it a lack of creative direction and caused it to meander and to lose focus.
