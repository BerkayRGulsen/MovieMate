== production ==
the sky pilot was filmed in part at vidor's new studio, vidor village and marked a break from the stage-bound feature the family honor (1920), a comedy-romance he had just completed for first national exhibitors. shot largely in the high sierra near truckee, california, this big budget western was plagued by bad weather. costly efforts to create landscapes on location produced budget overruns diminishing the profitability of the film. first national released the picture but declined to finance any further film projects by vidor.these financial setbacks signaled the demise of king vidor productions. courts ordered the dismantling of vidor village, and though vidor would briefly regain control of the studio operations there were not revived. he sold the property in january 1923.vidor and his leading lady, colleen moore, fell in love during the filming of the sky pilot. vidor and moore would pursue their love affair until 1924. married at the time to his childhood sweetheart and film actress florence vidor, vidor and his spouse divorced in 1926.


== theme ==
the film serves to showcase vidor's faith in the power of positive thinking, free of puritanism or christian moralizing, which celebrates the virtues of self-reliance and the inherent vitality of rural communities.the precise theme of the film remains ambiguous. according to sources, vidor attempts to entertain the audience with a light farce and sanctimoniously impress them with spectacular natural scenery, the latter "which is closest to vidors heart." the redemptive value of "individualist" faith provides a subtext for the movie, as john bowers as the manly sky pilot adroitly converts local ruffians to christian-like virtues. when cowboy bill hendricks (david butler is bested by the sky pilot in a fist fight he confesses: "when a mans religion will let him do what you done and live, there must something in it."
