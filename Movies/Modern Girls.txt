== plot summary ==
three girls in their early twenties, margo, kelly, and cece are roommates living in los angeles working menial jobs by day, and by night they enjoy the vibrant and decadent night life of 1980s los angeles.
margo (daphne zuniga) has a boring job in telemarketing, cece (cynthia gibb) gets fired from her job at a department store, while kelly (virginia madsen) works in a pet store and is very good at selling pets, mainly thanks to her looks.
it's friday night and the girls are getting ready for a night out on the town, however margo and cece soon discover that kelly has taken margo's car to go meet a dj she's infatuated with.
luckily, kelly's date for the night, clifford (clayton rohner, in a dual role), one of her many infatuated customers, arrives to pick her up, so margo and cece hitch a ride with him to go to the club where the dj is working. cliffie (as cece calls him) reluctantly tags along a roller-coaster ride with them and learns how the girls usually spend their nights out.
meeting rock star bruno x (rohner), surviving a police raid, getting dumped by dj brad, taking a trip on ecstasy, escaping from crazed fans and a run-in with a sexual criminal are some of the situations the group gets themselves into.
