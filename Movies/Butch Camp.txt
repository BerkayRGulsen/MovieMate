== stand up routine ==


=== persona ===
tenuta's act is primarily structured around an exaggerated, campy, and offbeat persona that is referred to primarily as "the love goddess". she has also styled herself with other monikers include "the petite flower", "aphrodite of the accordion", "fashion-plate saint", "queen of candy-pants", "princess of panty shields", "empress of elvis impersonators," and the "buffer of foreheads." her routine, which blends observational and insult humor, is a performance of surreal lunacy. the love goddess begins every show with her signature greeting hi pigs! before diving into a bawdy, chaotic, and whimsical whirlwind of stories, impressions, and songs.  one review of a 1987 performance reported that tenuta's show was a veritable onslaught of atavistic growlings and gum-chewing bimbo stances, filled with little nasties, crass jokes, and political offensiveness.tenuta often performs in an array of fantastical costumes made up of aphrodite dresses, feather boots, and gauzy capes and with a variety of propsmost notably her iconic accordion.


=== content and delivery ===
tenutas unique blend of observational and insult humor draws heavily from the borscht belt and vaudeville comedy styles. as the love goddess, tenuta regularly lampoons religion, politics, celebrities, sports, and current events. most of tenutas content pass through the filter of her faux religion judyism, which, in her own words, aims to help you forget about your problems and think about mine for a change. throughout her act, judy continuously works to convince the women in her audience to convert to judyism, and bloom into love goddesses themselves. although the demeanor is fanciful, her content has serious undertones. in a 2007 interview, tenuta explained that she uses over-the-top comedy to express her own anger at the world around her, saying "when i get angry about something, i have to make it into a joke. the thing with comedy is it relieves the pressure of tragedy. thats why people come [to see me].  giovanna del negro, a scholar who was studied and written about tenuta's career, has argued that "in juxtaposing the idealized love-goddess image with the aggressive, over-the-top dominatrix persona, we discover that play acting [in tenuta's performances], no matter how ludicrous, can provide a terrain for interrogating issues of gender, power, and sexuality, and gives those who do it an opportunity to think beyond predetermined social categories. the way tenuta pokes fun at traditional and shallow stereotypes of femininity reveals the anger that lies underneath the facade of female conformity. for members of the lgbt community, there is a special form of liberation that can be found in "the love goddesses" performance. by creating a space in which the "eccentric and outlandish is valorized," tenuta removes the "stigma associated with any form of marginalization." del negro contends that by immersing [themselves] in a world of this tender blossom with the brassy voice, queers of all kindsgay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or, more broadly, anyone with a non-normative gender performancecan bask in the loving glow of the material goddess and joyously perform their difference without fear of reprisal or judgment.


=== audience interaction ===
tenutas performances are renowned for a high level of audience interaction and participation. judy is known for picking on audience members, making them targets of her jokes and roping them in on-stage antics. one 1996 show review by the chicago tribune details a performance tenuta gave in her home town in which she partook in especially boisterous hijinks including: ordering a pizza directly to herself on stage and having the local pizza delivery man feed it to her; performing a fertility dance over the prostrate figure of the clubs booker; and having her own mother forced to feed pickled weiners to stud puppets [scantily clad men]. she even convinced two large and seemingly conservative surban gentlemen to engage in a peculiar and obscene dance with clown wigs, a set of fake breasts and large inflatable phallus. tenuta is especially known for bringing male audience members onto stage, and shoving her used gum into his mouth.


== gay rights ==
tenuta has been an outspoken advocate for gay rights and has amassed a faithful following in the lgbt community. during the early years of her career, tenuta frequently performed at gay bars and clubs around chicago, and has continued to perform at gay pride festivals and events across the country ever since. tenuta has publicly stated that she has always felt welcomed and supported by the gay community, and even offers on her official website to officiate same-sex marriages.
