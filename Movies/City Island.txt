meanwhile, vince's 20-year-old daughter vivian (played by the real-life daughter of her on-screen father) has not told her family that she has been suspended from college, lost her scholarship, gotten breast implants, and become a stripper to try to pay for her next semester; their youngest teenage child, vinnie, has a secret sexual fetish for feeding large women, and fantasizes about their fat next-door neighbor; and vince's wife, joyce, thinking she has lost all marital intimacy, sexually pursues tony without realizing that he is her stepson.
vince successfully auditions for a part in a martin scorsese film, while his wife and tony seek each other's sexual attention. vince, jr. befriends the neighbor, who helps to bring him closer to an overweight girl whom he has been attracted to at school.
