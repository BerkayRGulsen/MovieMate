== plot ==
richard, a young american seeking adventure in bangkok, stays in a drab travelers' hotel on khao san road where he meets a young french couple, franoise and tienne, and he immediately becomes attracted to franoise. he also meets daffy, who tells him of a pristine, uninhabited and restricted island in the gulf of thailand with a beautiful hidden beach and lagoon. daffy explains that he and other travelers settled there in secret several years earlier, but difficulties arose and he chose to leave. daffy commits suicide, leaving richard a map to the island. richard convinces franoise and tienne to accompany him to the island, and the three travel to ko samui. after getting locked out of his bungalow during a thunderstorm, richard meets two american surfers who have heard rumors of the island, including huge amounts of cannabis supposedly growing there. before departing, richard leaves them a copy of the map.
en route to the island, richard becomes infatuated with franoise. after swimming to the island from a neighboring one, they find a large cannabis plantation guarded by armed thai farmers. avoiding detection, they make their way across the island and meet english cricket fan keatey, who brings them to a fully functioning community of travelers living on the island, totally in secret. sal, the community's english leader, explains that the farmers allow them to stay so long as they keep to themselves and do not allow any more travelers to come to the island. richard lies that they have not shown the map to anyone else, which satisfies sal. the trio become integrated into the largely self-sufficient and leisurely community.
one night, franoise privately invites richard to the beach where she tells him that she is falling in love with him and they make love. despite hoping to keep it secret, the community finds out. while angry, tienne says he will not stand in their way if franoise is happier with richard.
tensions rise between richard and sal's south african boyfriend bugs. when richard gains popularity by killing a shark with his knife, bugs mocks him over the shark's small size. richard mocks him back for his jealousy.
when sal selects richard to accompany her on a supply run to ko pha ngan, bugs warns him to keep his hands off her. while there they encounter the american surfers richard met in ko samui, who are preparing to search for the island and mention richard's map. richard lies to sal that he did not give them a copy, and she coaxes him into having sex with her in exchange for her secrecy, despite the two having their respective partners. on their return to the island, richard lies to franoise about having sex with sal and continues his relationship with her.
things return to normal until a shark attack kills one of the community's fishermen, sten, and leaves another, christo, severely injured. sal refuses to compromise the community by bringing medical help, and christo is too traumatized to travel to the mainland by sea. his worsening condition affects the group's morale, so they isolate him in a tent, despite tienne's objections.
when the surfers from ko pha ngan turn up on the neighboring island, sal furiously orders richard to observe them until they cross over, then send them away and destroy their map. she also tells everyone that she and richard had sex, which leaves franoise angry and heartbroken, causing her to return to tienne. isolated from the group, richard begins to lose his sanity, stalking the cannabis farmers, stealing some of their personal items while they sleep, and imagining that he is conversing with the deceased daffy.
the surfers reach the island, but are discovered and killed by the farmers. shocked at witnessing their deaths, richard tries to gather franoise and tienne to leave the island. tienne refuses to leave christo, whose leg has become gangrenous, so richard euthanizes christo by suffocation.
richard is captured by the farmers and brought before the community, along with franoise and tienne. the farmers are furious with the community for breaking their deal to not allow any more newcomers. the lead farmer gives sal a gun loaded with a single bullet and orders her to make a choice: kill richard and the group will be allowed to stay, or else they must all leave immediately. sal pulls the trigger, but the chamber is empty. shocked by her willingness to commit murder, the other members of the community abandon sal, leave the island, and go their separate ways.
later, back in the united states, richard receives an email at an internet cafe from franoise with a nostalgic group photograph of the beach community in happier times.

== production ==

ewan mcgregor was cast as the main character before leaving due to disputes with the director. it was speculated that boyle was offered additional funding under the condition that dicaprio be cast and his character made american. whilst promoting t2 trainspotting on the graham norton show, the dispute was discussed in more depth, with mcgregor stating "it was a mis-handling and a mis-understanding over the film and it's a big regret of mine that it went on for so very long... and it didn't matter about the beach, it was never about that. it was about our friendship. i felt like danny's actor and it made me a bit rudderless." 
boyle stated, "i handled it very very badly and i have apologised to ewan for it. i felt a great shame about it and how it was handled."members of the cast and crew were involved in a boating accident during production. it was reported that the incident involved both boyle and dicaprio. no one was injured.the beach seen in the film is not the same as in real life. there is a gap between mountains on the actual beach in thailand. the special effects crew digitally added some of the surrounding mountains during the post-production phase.
boyle has been cited saying that the look of the jungle scenes in the film was inspired by the nintendo game banjo-kazooie.the waterfall scene, where dicaprio and others jump from a high cliff to the water below, was filmed in khao yai national park in central thailand, at the haew suwat waterfall.
the map in the film was illustrated by the author of the book that the beach was based upon, alex garland. he received credit for this as the cartographer.

=== certifications ===


== reception ==
on rotten tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 20% based on 119 reviews, and an average rating of 4.4/10. the website's critical consensus reads, "the beach is unfocused and muddled, a shallow adaptation of the novel it is based on. points go to the gorgeous cinematography, though." on metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".critics suggested that dicaprio's fame post-titanic might have contributed to the financial success of this film, which came out less than three years after the james cameron blockbuster. cnn's paul clinton said "leonardo dicaprio's main fan base of screaming adolescent girls won't be disappointed with the beach. the majority of the film displays the titanic-sized young heartthrob sans his shirt in this story about the pseudo-angst and alienation of a young man from the united states escaping civilization and his computer-obsessed generation." he agreed with most others that the beach was "nothing to write home about". dicaprio was nominated for a razzie award for worst actor for his work on the film.


== controversies ==


=== damage to filming location ===
controversy arose during the making of the film due to 20th century fox's bulldozing and landscaping of the natural beach setting of ko phi phi leh to make it more "paradise-like". the production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed.  following shooting of the film, there was a clear flat area at one end of the beach that was created artificially with an odd layout of trees which was never rectified, and the entire area remained damaged from the original state until the tsunami of 2004.
the lawsuits dragged on for years. in 2006, thailand's supreme court upheld an appellate court ruling that the filming had harmed the environment and ordered that damage assessments be made. defendants in the case included 20th century fox and some thai government officials.the large increase in tourist traffic to the beach as a result of the film resulted in environmental damage to the bay and the nearby coral reefs, prompting thai authorities to close the beach until 2021.


=== portrayal of thailand ===
after the film premiered in thailand in 2000, some thai politicians were upset at the way thailand was depicted in the film and called for it to be banned. the depiction of the drug culture was said to give thailand a bad image and having a statue of buddha in a bar was cited as "blasphemous".


== possible spin-off ==
in a 2019 interview with the independent, danny boyle revealed that a television series based on his film has been written by amy seimitz. the proposed series is set to take place before the events from the 1996 novel, although it will be updated to occur 20 years later, in 2016.
