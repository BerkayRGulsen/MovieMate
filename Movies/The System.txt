== reception ==
when the film was first released, the new york times' review was brutal.  the film critic wrote, "it seems quite appropriate for warner brothers' the system, a stultified excursion into contemporary crime, to have opened at the palace yesterday. the morning weather was drab and depressing. so was the picture ... the sad fact to be faced is that there is not a single thing to recommend the system. the performance of the feminine lead, joan weldon, is embarrassing in its inadequacy. mr. lovejoy makes an honest effort in a professional way, but the script is such a peachy morass he has no chance. that lewis seiler, the director, should fail so is more disappointing when one recalls his memorable guadalcanal diary." forget this fiasco, for it is one of those soggy melodramas that serve only to fill out double bills."
