a diamond potentially worth $2 million, the "blue goddess," must be cut. a new york city jeweler, bainbridge gibbons, has an expert lined up, but his own diamond cutter, ambrose c. park, strongly urges gibbons to let him do the cutting.

ambrose is arrested after inadvertently becoming drunk in public. a shyster lawyer, remlick, offers to help for $400, then takes a greater interest when ambrose offers to pay much more if his parents could be located. a couple of con artists become involved, with nightclub dancer maggie drumman and her mother emily hired to pretend to be ambrose's real sister and mom.
