=== critical response ===

for the most part, the film was either ignored or attacked by critics.  david cornelius of dvd talk.com gave the film a negative review saying,

the script is rambling and forgetful ... its characters lack the very charm the movie is convinced it's oozing, the tennis sequences are maddeningly dull, the romance is vacant. this is the kind of movie that thinks it's a blast because it shows us college kids getting drunk and leering at women, not realizing that you need to put in these things called "jokes" to make such a premise work.
