== production ==
the title role was initially offered to ajith kumar, who rejected the film citing that bala had not fully developed the story and screenplay before narrating the terms to him. ajith's departure meant that the film's proposed producer, poornachandra rao, also backed out. suriya, who had notably also replaced ajith kumar in nerukku ner to make his debut, was selected as his replacement. the director also tried to rope in sivaji ganesan for a character role in the film, but his unavailability led to rajkiran being cast. despite initial reports that kiran would work on the film, laila was signed on as heroine to play a sri lankan refugee, kalyani.the role required suriya to undergo physical change, so production was delayed until suriya had finished filming for friends and uyirile kalanthathu. the first look of the film created media anticipation, with both suriya and rajkiran sporting looks which they had not portrayed before. post-release, suriya has stated "when nandha happened, everything changed. i became a serious actor, and director bala instilled in me the discipline to work without committing errors."


== release ==
the satellite rights of the film were sold to sun tv. the critic from the hindu noted that "powerful performance by the lead artists, a neat screenplay and narration without any deviations in the form of dance or song make nandhaa worth watching. bala's direction makes viewing a gripping experience." the critic added that "surya as the young rustic man has reached a new milestone in acting. rajkiran shines in the role of periyavar. a surprise, however, is rajashri, who reveals great histrionic skills." in comparison, rediff.com stated the film failed to live up to expectations, likening it to kamal haasan's aalavandhan and stated that "the screenplay is smooth and incident-driven. in the final analysis, it is the climax that may be the main reason why the audience does not lap up this film."prior to its release film faced many troubles. the film was telecast in tv channels during first week of the film release but the film got a big hit response in theatre.  the film has been dubbed and released in the telugu language three times, firstly as aakrosham (2006) and then as pratheekaram in 2009. a third dubbed version titled bala-surya was released by nagamalla shankar in 2011, shortly after the release of bala's avan ivan.
