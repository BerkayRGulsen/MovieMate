== plot ==
the story is a flashback of the five years (2005 to 2010) of love affair involving the characters of allan alvarez (john lloyd cruz) and mia samonte (bea alonzo).  the opening scene was in a pasig river ferry boat.  one of the passenger, allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, daphne recto (maricar reyes). while another passenger, mia, was downtrodden by family problems. to express her heartaches, mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began.
later, in one of their trysts, they met an old man (noel trinidad) in paco park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride.   
allan was torn between two loves. although he knew that he loved mia more, he procrastinated in his choice.  mia left for malaysia.  two years after, when allan  finally broke free from his indecision, he went to malaysia to look for mia only to find out that she was already engaged to another guy.  it was now mia's turn to make a choice.  she chose the new guy who loved her so much and the one she knew could help her support her family. even though she honestly knew in her heart that she still loved allan.
allan did not lose hope.  he patiently waited for mia for another three years.  he firmly believed that she would come back to him as predicted by the old man earlier in the story.  true enough, the malaysian guy let mia go as he was aware of who mia truly wanted and her intention of choosing him over allan.  on the very same date foreseen by the old man, mia returned to the philippines, saw allan waiting for her, and embraced each other.
