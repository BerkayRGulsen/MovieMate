== plot summary ==
in new york city, detective eddie santos and mob figure tino zapatti kill each other in a shootout; a stray bullet also kills a child passing by. in the wake of the tragedy, questions are raised as to why judge walter stern, an old friend of the ambitious mayor john pappas, had previously set the criminal responsible free on probation. pappas' loyal deputy mayor, kevin calhoun, decides to dig for answers. meanwhile, legal aid marybeth cogan uncovers a conspiracy to smear santos.
calhoun's investigation leads to frank anselmo, a brooklyn politician who has connections to tino's uncle, crime boss paul zapatti. anselmo plants money at zapatti's behest to frame santos. calhoun and cogan continue to seek the truth from a number of sources, including santos' partner and another zapatti relative. after the murder of probation officer larry schwartz, they ultimately conclude that judge stern had to be on the take. pappas agrees that stern must resign.
the scandal snowballs to the point where zapatti instructs anselmo to commit suicide rather than become an informer or go to jail. to protect his family, anselmo shoots himself. calhoun uncovers evidence that pappas put stern together with anselmo to receive a bribe and leave the young zapatti on the street. calhoun soon tells pappas there is only one choiceto quit as mayor and leave politics for good ("you're gonna take yourself out, john. you're gonna take yourself out.").
pappas and calhoun share an emotional goodbye, and pappas retires from politics. calhoun runs for mayor and loses the election, but he remains steadfast on trying to make a place for himself in politics and also make the city a better place to live on.

== menschkeit ==
a key concept in the film is the yiddish word menschkeit, which mayor pappas defines as something "about honor and character" and "the space between a handshake." mayor pappas is always making deals, and the question becomes whether he can retain his honor in a world of political deal-making. a deal to fund a subway station serving a new financial center is honorable because the station will make the developers of, and workers at, the center better off, and their taxes will ultimately pay for it. the deal pappas makes with known mafiosi to persuade a judge to reduce a prison sentence isn't honorable because mafiosi are not honorable. calhoun holds pappas accountable for breaching his own moral code, but does it with deep personal sympathy and respect, that is as a mensch.
