== plot ==
kushal (rakshit shetty) is sent by his radio jockey sister rachana to palibetta near kodagu to meet her boyfriend's sister, dr.ithihasini, in the hope that the two will take a liking to each other, leading to marriage, and thus paving the way for her own marriage.
kushal meets a bubbly girl (shwetha srivatsav) who claims to be ithihasini, and says the rest of the family is out of town. the two share their past romantic liaisons. ithihasini's actions seem a little odd and her responses to kushal's questions all avoid direct answers so it's not really a surprise when kushal's sister calls to tell him that the girl he has been spending time with is not ithihasini at all. when confronted the fake ithihasini comes up with a number of different stories, but kushal finds her even more intriguing as a result and declares his love for her despite not knowing who she actually is, although he does finally discover her real name is khushi. khushi is suffering from anterograde amnesia (loss of memory), the story takes a drastic leap from here.
