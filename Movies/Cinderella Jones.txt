== reception ==
bosley crowther of the new york times said, "if you can imagine a combination of a nineteen thirties "college musical" and a second-rate silent slapstick shot completely "off the cuff," then you can picture in your mind's eye the warners' cinderella jones, a little package of fluff and painful cut-ups which came to the strand yesterday. and we trust that you can so imagine, for it would be very difficult indeed to convey a more accurate impression of this nonsensical and amateurish film."
