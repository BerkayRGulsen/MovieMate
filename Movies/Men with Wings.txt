during world war i, falconer becomes a fighter pilot and after the war continues to fly by "the seat-of-his-pants" rather than do the methodical work of flight research like barnes. as the 1930s come to a close, restless falconer leaves his family and friend behind, taking off for china to fight japanese invaders.

== reception ==
men with wings received good reviews from critics and audience alike. variety noted the film  "is a giant bomber from the paramount hangar, designed on a lavish scale by the skilled air picture mechanic, william a. wellman, and polished off beautifully in technicolor. the action scenes, including a dog fight in the air, are exceptionally impressive. men with wings was considered an aviation classic, "one of the best pre-war flight films, true to life, and done without replicas ... a buff's dream." the juxtaposing of a love interest, however, was jarring, with critics commenting on that plotline being forced.
