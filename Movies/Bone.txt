== theme ==
larry cohen explained the theme of the movie in a 2019 interview: "it deals with problems we still face today in america. the film is revolutionary because it cuts to the heart of racial prejudice. and some of that is indeed sexual, where the white man has a fear of the black mans sexuality. its a thorn in the side of the white community. theyre still afraid of black people. in many cities white people will cross the street when they see black people coming."
