freddy is a driver for mr. paris, a gangster. he is slick and self-confident, married to a materialistic woman named sharon.
one day, a young woman named sonya kirk who works in a morgue accidentally comes across a letter indicating that the twins are actually the offspring of european nobility and owed a large sum of inheritance money. sonya decides to play amateur detective and track them down.
it all leads to a confrontation between the surprised twins in a restaurant, a shootout and a final scene high above the grand canyon.

== critical reception ==
the new york times movie reviewer stephen holden had praise for the actors, saying modine "does a fine job of differentiating between the two without resorting to caricature. he is especially good at showing how the repressed qualities of each twin peek through their surfaces. as henry's sweetheart, ms. boyle exudes the right mixture of warm-blooded ardor and strait-laced defensiveness."
