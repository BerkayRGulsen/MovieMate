morons from outer space is a 1985 british comedy-science fiction film directed by mike hodges and starring griff rhys jones, mel smith, joanne pearce, jimmy nail and james b. sikking.


== plot ==
the story begins on a small spaceship docking with a refuelling station. on board are a group of four aliens called bernard, sandra, desmond, and julian. during a particularly tedious period of their stay at the station, the other three begin playing with the ship's controls while bernard is outside playing spaceball. they accidentally disconnect his part of the ship, leaving him stranded while they crash into a large blue planet close by (earth).
the aliens become instant celebrities on arrival, despite being able to bring no great revelation or technical ability to the people of earth (as is central to the plot of many "aliens on earth" films). they find a manager (jones) and become wealthy more or less overnight, packing fans in auditoriums just to see them. meanwhile, bernard arrives on earth via other means of transport. despite being by far the most intelligent of the group, bernard is not afforded any celebrity, and is in fact condemned to vagrancy and a brief stint in a mental hospital before reuniting with his fellow travellers near the end of the film. the others, fearing that the introduction of bernard would lessen their popularity and celebrity, fail to mention that they had originally been travelling with a fourth.

=== critical ===
the observer called the film "so embarassingly unfunny i often felt like crawling under my seat."mike hodges disliked the film, regarding it as a "misfire". he clashed with smith and jones in post production, an article claiming "they did not trust, or perhaps understand his comedic judgement or cinematic visual satire and the film became far more broad than he had intended."  however he did enjoy satirising the sentimental spielbergian vision of the world.
