the team continues on their losing streak. in the meantime, the three younger brothers of muthu the goalkeeper are injured in an attempt to help their father deliver coconuts by driving the lorry. fed up with muthu's (fruitless) football endeavours and him not being able to help with work, muthu's father reprimands him. muthu contemplates also about quitting the team out of perceived incompetence, but does not do so.
