== production ==
when interviewed by cjad radio of montreal, chantal chamandy spoke toward the production of this film. one year after creation of her production company chantal chamandy entertainment, chamandy began production on the film hit by lightning. the film was shot over a 17-day period during summer 2013 in a studio in metro ottawa, locations through the city, as well as locations in los angeles. the film was budgeted at c$1 million provided by private funding and through telefilm canada, and had no cost overruns. ricky blitt had written the script and was invited to montreal by chamandy to direct the film as his directorial debut. jon cryer was production's first choice for the lead role, and he accepted the role after discussing the script with blitt. the film is described by cryer as "sort of a mixture of body heat meets the 40-year-old virgin.
what i loved about the script was that it was a romantic comedy with a new twist. it's a really sweet story but it has a real darkness to it. i haven't done a romantic comedy in a long, long time and it took a lovely script to make me do this kind of thing again
will sasso was production's first choice for the supporting role of seth. after he and cryer had met and discussed it, they clicked and he also came immediately aboard. casting was completed within six months. to take advantage of canadian tax credits, most of the project was filmed in ottawa, and post-production and music scoring was done in montreal.
