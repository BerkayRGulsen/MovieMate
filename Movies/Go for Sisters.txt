== plot ==
bernice (lisagay hamilton) is a tough, no-nonsense parole officer whose son has gone missing. fontayne (yolonda ross) is her old high school buddy whose brush with a possible parole violation lands her case on bernice's desk. when bernice discovers that her son is a possible murder suspect, she enlists fontayne in a quest to rescue her son from what turns out to be drug lords and a chinese snakehead. before they cross the border into tijuana and mexicali, bernice also enlists the help of freddy suarez (edward james olmos), a disgraced myopic ex-cop, whose nickname used to be "the terminator".
as the story unfolds, mahershala ali, isaiah washington and harold perrineau each deliver brief but plot-twisting cameos.

=== critical response ===
it has a rating of 72% on rotten tomatoes based on 53 critic reviews. film critic stephen holden of the new york times wrote in his review: "as a crime drama, go for sisters never gains traction. like most of mr. sayless films, go for sisters has a sociopolitical subtext  in this case, suggested by fontayne: how is a parolee to avoid breaking the law by associating with drug dealers in an environment where theyre everywhere? she is trapped on a lower rung of the economic ladder."
