==== debut and intercontinental champion (19961997) ====
johnson made his wwf debut as rocky maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather's ring names, although his real name was acknowledged by the announcers. he was initially reluctant to take this ring name but was persuaded by vince mcmahon and jim ross. he was given the nickname "the blue chipper" and his lineage was played to on tv, where he was hyped as the wwf's first third-generation wrestler. maivia, a clean-cut face character, was pushed heavily from the start despite his wrestling inexperience. he debuted on monday night raw as a member of marc mero's entourage on november 4, 1996. his first match came at survivor series, on november 17, in an eight-man elimination tag match; he was the sole survivor and eliminated the final two members of the opposing team, crush and goldust. on february 13, 1997, he won the intercontinental championship from hunter hearst helmsley on monday night raw. maivia then successfully defended the title against helmsley at in your house 13: final four. he had his first wrestlemania match at wrestlemania 13 where he was victorious in his intercontinental championship defense against the sultan. wwf fans started to reject his character and push from the company. he defeated bret hart by disqualification in a title defense on the march 31 episode of raw is war. behind the scenes, hart mentored johnson for his first year in wwf and refused to be booked to take the title from him. on april 20, at in your house 14: revenge of the 'taker, he lost to savio vega by countout but retained the title. audiences became increasingly hostile toward maivia, with chants of "die, rocky, die" and "rocky sucks" being heard during his matches.


==== the nation of domination (19971998) ====
after losing the intercontinental championship to owen hart on the april 28, 1997 episode of raw is war and suffering a legitimate knee injury in a match against mankind, maivia returned in august 1997 and turned heel for the first time in his career by lashing out at fans who had been booing him and joining faarooq, d'lo brown and kama in the stable called the nation of domination. he then refused to acknowledge the rocky maivia name, instead referring to himself in the third person as the rock, though he would still be billed as "the rock" rocky maivia until 1998. the rock would then regularly insult the audience, wwf performers, and interviewers in his promos.at d-generation x: in your house, stone cold steve austin defeated the rock in under six minutes to retain the intercontinental championship. the next night on raw is war, austin was ordered by mr. mcmahon to defend the title in a rematch, but forfeited it to the rock instead, handing him the title belt before hitting him with the stone cold stunner. the rock feuded with austin and ken shamrock through the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998. on january 19, 1998, at royal rumble, the rock defeated shamrock by disqualification to retain the intercontinental title. later that night, he entered the royal rumble match and lasted until the final two before he was eliminated by stone cold steve austin. on march 29, at wrestlemania xiv, he defeated shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. the next night, on raw is war, the rock debuted a new intercontinental championship design and would later overthrow faarooq as leader of the nation of domination to spark a feud between the two. he then successfully defended the intercontinental title against faarooq at over the edge: in your house on may 31. the stable would then refer to themselves as simply "the nation".the rock and the nation then feuded with triple h and d-generation x, with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the 1998 king of the ring tournament, which the rock won. at king of the ring, the rock defeated dan severn in the semi-final match and lost to rival ken shamrock in the final. the rock then resumed his feud with triple h, as the two had a two out of three falls match at fully loaded: in your house for the intercontinental title, which the rock retained in controversial fashion. this led to a ladder match at summerslam, where the rock lost the title.the rock saw a big uptick in fan support during this time, causing him to be booked in a feud with fellow nation members mark henry and d'lo brown, turning babyface in the process. henry defeated him at judgment day: in your house, after interference from brown, effectively breaking up the stable.


==== wwf champion and rise to superstardom (19982000) ====

the rock was then entered into the "deadly game" tournament for the vacant wwf championship. the finals occurred at survivor series, where the rock defeated vince mcmahon's associate, mankind, to win his first wwf championship. a "double turn" then occurred as the rock turned heel again after allying with vince and shane mcmahon as the crown jewel of their stable, the corporation, after the mcmahons betrayed mankind. on december 13, 1998, at the pay-per-view named after him, rock bottom: in your house, the rock had a rematch with mankind for the wwf championship. mankind appeared to win the match when the rock passed out to the mandible claw submission move, but vince mcmahon ruled that since the rock did not tap out, he retained his title.the rock continued to feud with mankind over the wwf championship, which was traded back and forth between them. first, in the main event of the january 4, 1999 episode of raw is war, mankind defeated the rock after interference from stone cold steve austin. then at the royal rumble on january 24, the rock regained the title in a brutal i quit match, a type of submission match that only ends if one of the combatants says i quit on a microphone. intended to show a vicious mean streak in the rock's character, this match went horribly wrong as at the end of the match the rock hit mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being a risky amount (most wrestling matches in the attitude era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). after the 5th shot, mankind was still at ringside instead of being two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot which knocked a bloodied mankind out, a recording of mankind saying "i quit" from an earlier interview was played over the public address system. on january 31, during an episode of sunday night heat, the rock and mankind participated in an empty arena match, a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match. after 20 minutes of chaotic brawling in the ring, the stands, a kitchen, the catering area, an office, the arena corridors and finally a basement loading area, mankind pinned the rock using a forklift truck to win the wwf title. this match was referred to as "halftime heat" as it was televised during halftime of that year's super bowl. the two faced off again, at st. valentine's day massacre: in your house, in a last man standing match which ended in a draw, meaning mankind retained the title. their feud ended on the february 15 raw is war, when the rock won his third wwf championship in a ladder match after a debuting big show interfered on his behalf. the rock then lost the wwf championship to stone cold steve austin at wrestlemania xv.the rock's popularity continued to grow and audiences still cheered for him even though he was a heel. he then lost the title rematch against stone cold steve austin at backlash: in your house. the next night on raw is war he was fired from the corporation after he was betrayed by shane mcmahon, turning him face again and starting a feud with triple h, the undertaker and the corporate ministry. on april 29, 1999, wwf aired the pilot episode of smackdown!, a term derived from one of the rock's catchphrases. in the episode, the rock continued his feud with the corporate ministry. this led to a match with triple h, at over the edge, which the rock won, and a match for the wwf championship against the undertaker, at king of the ring, which the rock lost. the rock then lost a number one contender's match to triple h, at fully loaded, after interference from "mr. ass" billy gunn. the rock then defeated gunn in a kiss my ass match at summerslam. the rock was also given the privilege of having his own signature match, like the undertaker with the buried alive match, kane with the inferno match and mankind with the boiler room brawl: the brahma bullrope match, a variant of a strap match was a normal singles match where the components are tied together with a rope used for cattle farming, and the rope and its attached cowbell could both be used as weapons. the rock contested this match twice, both times in texas (vs triple h in dallas, and vs al snow in houston).

shortly after summerslam, the rock began teaming with former opponent mankind and the two became known as the rock 'n' sock connection. they became wwf tag team champions for the first time after defeating the undertaker and big show for the titles on the august 30, 1999 episode of raw is war. the two performed a number of critically acclaimed comedic skits together, including one called "this is your life", which saw mankind bring parody versions of people from the rock's past on television, such as his high school girlfriend and his high school football coach, only to have the rock insult them. the segment earned an 8.4 nielsen rating, one of the highest ratings ever for a raw segment. the two lost the titles back to undertaker and big show on the september 7, 1999 episode of smackdown! and won them back from them on the september 20, 1999 episode of raw is war. rock and mankind then lost the titles to the new age outlaws on the very next episode smackdown!. rock and mankind would win the tag titles for the third and final time after beating the new age outlaws on the october 12, 1999 episode of smackdown! before losing the titles to the holly cousins on the october 18, 1999 episode of raw is war.at royal rumble, on january 23, 2000, the rock entered the royal rumble match and was one of the final two remaining, along with big show. in an attempt at a "false finish", big show intended to throw the rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, before the rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending big show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. however, the rock's feet accidentally hit the floor during the reversal attempt although those watching the event on television did not see that. this was played up in the storyline as big show provided additional video footage showing this fact, and claimed to be the rightful winner. the rock's number one contendership for the wwf championship was then put on the line against big show at no way out, which big show won after shane mcmahon interfered. the rock then defeated big show, on the march 13 episode of raw is war, to regain the right to face the wwf champion, triple h, at wrestlemania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including big show and mick foley. each wrestler had a mcmahon in his corner: triple h had his wife stephanie, foley had linda, the rock had vince and big show had shane. the rock lasted until the final two but was eliminated by then-reigning champion triple h after vince betrayed him by hitting him with a chair.


==== record-breaking world champion (20002002) ====

in the following weeks, the rock continued his feud with triple h and eventually won his fourth wwf championship, which he won on april 30, at backlash, after stone cold steve austin intervened on his behalf. the following night on raw, he successfully defended his title against shane mcmahon in a steel cage match. on may 21, at judgment day, the rock faced triple h in an iron man match with shawn michaels as the special guest referee. with the score tied at five falls each, and with seconds left on the time limit, the rock was disqualified when the undertaker attacked triple h, thus giving triple h the 65 win and the title. the rock won the wwf championship for a fifth time at king of the ring on june 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with kane and the undertaker against shane mcmahon, triple h and vince mcmahon, whom he pinned. the rock successfully defended the championship against chris benoit, on july 23, at fully loaded. the next month, he successfully defended his title against kurt angle and triple h at summerslam. the rock had another successful title defense against benoit, kane and the undertaker, on september 24, at unforgiven.the rock then lost the wwf championship to kurt angle, at no mercy, in october. the next month, the rock feuded with rikishi and defeated him at survivor series. the rock wrestled a six-man hell in a cell match for the wwf championship, at armageddon, which angle won to retain the title. on the december 18 episode of raw, the rock won the wwf tag team championship with the undertaker, defeating edge and christian, before losing it back to them the next night at a smackdown! taping. in 2001, the rock continued to feud with angle over the wwf championship, culminating at no way out in february, where he pinned angle to win the wwf championship for a sixth time. the rock then feuded with the royal rumble winner, stone cold steve austin, whom he lost the title to at wrestlemania x-seven after austin allied with vince mcmahon, who interfered on his behalf. on the next night's raw is war, during a steel cage title rematch, triple h attacked the rock, allying with mcmahon and austin and helping austin retain the championship. austin and triple h then formed a tag team called the power trip, while the rock was indefinitely suspended in storyline. johnson used this time off to act in the scorpion king.

the rock returned in late july 2001 when the wwf was feuding with rival promotions world championship wrestling (wcw) and extreme championship wrestling (ecw) during what's known as the invasion storyline. in reality, wcw was purchased by vince mcmahon and the wwf, and ecw had gone out of business in early 2001. many former wcw and ecw wrestlers were then brought onto wwf television and formed the alliance to compete with wwf in storyline. the alliance and vince mcmahon then both attempted to persuade the rock to join their team. the rock then aligned with mcmahon and the wwf. the next month, the rock defeated booker t, at summerslam, to win the wcw championship for the first time. he later lost the title to chris jericho at no mercy. the next night on raw, he teamed with jericho to win the wwf tag team championship from the dudley boyz. the two then lost the tag titles to booker t and test on the november 1, 2001 episode of smackdown!. the rock defeated jericho on the november 5 episode of raw for his second wcw championship.as part of the wwf's battle against the alliance, the rock wrestled in a "winner takes all" five-on-five elimination tag team match at survivor series where the losing team's company would be dissolved in storyline. he was a member of team wwf along with chris jericho, the undertaker, kane, and big show. the alliance's team consisted of stone cold steve austin, kurt angle, booker t, rob van dam, and shane mcmahon. in the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the rock and stone cold steve austin. the rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate jericho entered the ring and attacked the rock. austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning the rock, but kurt angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking austin. the rock then pinned austin, giving team wwf the victory and forcing the alliance to disband. the rock's wcw championship was renamed the unbranded "world championship" following the alliance's loss. at the next pay-per-view, vengeance, the rock lost the world championship to jericho, who would then unify the wwf and world titles later that night. the rock then unsuccessfully challenged jericho for the now undisputed wwf championship at royal rumble.

at the next pay-per-view, no way out, the rock defeated the undertaker in a singles match. the event also saw the wwf debut of the famed wcw faction new world order, which at the time consisted of "hollywood" hulk hogan, kevin nash, and scott hall. this later led to a match between the rock and hogan at wrestlemania x8. the match was billed as "icon versus icon", with both men representing the top tier of two generations of wrestling; ultimately the rock pinned hogan at wrestlemania x8. despite the rock portraying a heroic character and hogan a villain, a portion of the crowd attending the skydome was rooting heavily for hogan. in an interview in 2013, hogan said he and the rock changed the style of the match on the fly based on the crowd's response. after the introduction of the first-ever brand extension, the wwf held a "draft lottery" on the march 25, 2002 episode of raw. the rock was the number one overall pick, going to the smackdown! brand before taking a sabbatical from wrestling.the rock made a surprise return on a june episode of raw before going to his assigned brand of smackdown!. there, he was named the number one contender for the wwe undisputed championship, which he won for a record-setting seventh time at vengeance, on july 21, by defeating kurt angle and then-champion the undertaker in a triple threat match. the rock successfully defended the title at the global warning event in melbourne, australia, against triple h and brock lesnar after pinning triple h. on august 25, at summerslam, after interference from lesnar's manager paul heyman, the rock lost the wwe undisputed championship to lesnar along with the record for the youngest wwe champion, which he had set in 1998. in 2018, writing for espn.com, sean coyle noted in a retrospective review of the event, that following his victory over hulk hogan at wrestlemania x8, the rock "started to see a dip in fan support" and "that dip turned into a plunge" by the time rock had his match with lesnar at summerslam because fans knew he was leaving wwe to pursue an acting career. this was evident by the fact that he was met with a negative crowd response during his match against lesnar. after the event ended, the rock was visibly angry at the crowd reaction. when he tried to do a post-show speech for the crowd, the fans attending the nassau coliseum would still boo him. the rock then took time off to kickstart his acting career.


==== final feuds and first retirement (20032004) ====
the rock returned on the january 30, 2003 episode of smackdown! to set up another match with hulk hogan at no way out. because of negative fan reaction during his previous couple of matches as a result of his budding acting career, the rock turned heel again. the rock then defeated hogan at no way out before assigning himself to the raw brand. there, he had various small feuds, including one with the hurricane. he also began performing "rock concerts", segments in which he played the guitar and mocked wwe performers and fans in song.

after failing to win a number one contendership for the world heavyweight championship, the rock went into another program with stone cold steve austin. this led to a match at wrestlemania xix, which called back to their previous two wrestlemania encounters, both of which austin had won. the rock won after delivering three consecutive rock bottoms, ending their long-running rivalry in what turned out to be austin's final match. the next night, raw was billed as "the rock appreciation night", in honor of his victory over austin. that night, he was attacked by a debuting goldberg. at backlash, goldberg defeated the rock, who then briefly left wwe to film walking tall.throughout the rest of the year, the rock made occasional appearances, returning to a face character. in 2004, the rock aided mick foley in his feud against evolution, leading to a reunion of the rock 'n' sock connection. they lost against ric flair, randy orton, and batista in a handicap match at wrestlemania xx, when orton pinned foley after an rko. this would be johnson's final wrestling match until november 2011. the rock appeared in wwe sporadically following wrestlemania xx. he made returns to provide support for eugene against jonathan coachman, and made a cameo in his hometown of miami and helped mick foley against la rsistance. later in 2004, he hosted a pie-eating contest, as part of the wwe diva search, and ended the segment by giving coachman a people's elbow. the rock's contract with wwe then ended and he started his full-time acting career.


=== return to wwe ===


==== non-wrestling appearances (20072009) ====
on march 12, 2007, the rock appeared on a wwe show after nearly three years, via a pre-taped promo shown during raw. he correctly predicted that bobby lashley would defeat umaga at wrestlemania 23 in donald trump and vince mcmahon's "battle of the billionaires" hair vs hair match. on march 29, 2008, johnson appeared to induct his father rocky johnson and grandfather peter maivia into the wwe hall of fame. johnson's next appearance was through a pre-taped promo on october 2, 2009 during the decade of smackdown.


==== feud with john cena (20112013) ====

on april 3, at wrestlemania xxvii, the rock opened the show by cutting a promo. after appearing in numerous backstage segments, the rock came to ringside to restart the main event between cena and the miz as a no disqualification match, after it had ended in a draw. as revenge for the attitude adjustment cena had given him on raw, rock hit cena with the rock bottom, allowing the miz to pin him and retain the wwe championship. after the match, rock attacked miz and hit him with the people's elbow. the following night on raw, the rock and cena agreed to a match at wrestlemania xxviii the next year. they then worked together to fend off an attack by the corre, which at the time consisted of wade barrett, heath slater, justin gabriel, and ezekiel jackson.the rock appeared live on raw in his hometown of miami to celebrate his 39th birthday. on september 16, wwe announced the rock would wrestle in a traditional 5-on-5 survivor series tag team match, teaming with cena at survivor series in november. however, on the october 24 episode of raw, cena instead suggested the rock be his partner in a standard tag team match against the miz and r-truth, a team called awesome truth, which rock agreed to the following week. on november 14, during the special raw gets rocked, the rock appeared live, delivering rock bottoms to mick foley, who had been hosting a "this is your life"-style segment for cena, and later both members of awesome truth. the rock and cena defeated awesome truth on november 20 at survivor series, when the rock pinned the miz. after the match, the rock gave cena a rock bottom.

leading up to wrestlemania, the rock and cena had several verbal confrontations on raw. on the march 12, 2012 episode of raw, the rock hosted his first "rock concert" segment since 2004, mocking cena in his songs. on april 1, at wrestlemania xxviii, the rock beat cena in the main event after countering cena's attempt at a people's elbow into a rock bottom. this event broke the record for biggest professional wrestling pay-per-view buyrate. the following night on raw, the rock praised cena, calling their match "an honor". he then vowed to once again become wwe champion.on july 23, at raw 1000, the rock announced he would wrestle for the wwe championship at the royal rumble pay-per-view. during the show, he encountered then-reigning wwe champion cm punk, daniel bryan, and john cena, all of whom expressed a desire to face him. the rock later saved cena from an assault by big show, only to be laid out by cm punk. on the january 7, 2013 episode of raw, the rock returned to confront his rumble opponent cm punk. on january 11, he made his first smackdown appearance in ten years, getting into an altercation with team rhodes scholars, resulting in him delivering a rock bottom to damien sandow and a people's elbow to cody rhodes. the rock closed out the 20th-anniversary episode of raw, on january 14, with one of his "rock concerts", leading to a brawl with cm punk. the following week on raw, the rock was attacked by the shield. vince mcmahon then asserted that if the shield attacked the rock in his title match with cm punk, punk would be stripped of the wwe championship.

on january 27, at royal rumble, cm punk would seemingly defeat the rock after the arena lights went out and someone attacked the rock. vince mcmahon then came out and was about to strip punk of the championship, however, at the rock's request, he instead restarted the match. this culminated in the rock defeating punk to win his eighth wwe championship. punk received a title rematch with the rock, at elimination chamber, with the added stipulation that if the rock was disqualified or counted out, he would still lose the wwe championship. the rock would pin punk to retain the championship. the following night on raw, the rock unveiled a new wwe championship design, with a different center plate and removable customizable side-plates which had his "brahma bull" logo. the rock then resumed his rivalry with john cena, who won that year's royal rumble to set up a rematch of the previous wrestlemania match between the two at wrestlemania 29, only this time with the wwe championship on the line.on april 7, at wrestlemania 29, rock lost the wwe championship to cena, ending his reign at 70 days. despite being advertised for raw after wrestlemania, where it was stated that the rock was still entitled a rematch for the wwe championship, the rock did not appear because of a legitimate injury sustained during his match with cena, in which his abdominal and adductor tendons tore from his pelvis. johnson underwent surgery on april 23 to reattach the torn tendons.
