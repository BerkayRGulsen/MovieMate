after returning from oxford, emelia begins feeling guilty about her affair with jonathan and starts distancing herself from him. she also deals with the death of her grandmother. days after the funeral, beth falls ill, which emelia suspects to be morning sickness. emelia gets her  from the pharmacy a pregnancy test. as she drops off the test in beth's room, jonathan calls her to the attic. emelia tells jonathan she has given up trying to write a novel and admonishes him for not living a single day since writing the cliff house. meanwhile, joa catches beth with the pregnancy test, which indicates she is not pregnant. emelia returns to beth's room while joa angrily informs jonathan about beth and chastises his parenting again. a disheartened jonathan admits his affair with emelia. enraged, joa yells "... you have been fucking our daughter's best friend?", which is overheard by beth. joa kicks jonathan out of the house.

== production ==
albatross is bafta-nominated director niall maccormick's debut feature film and the first screenplay by tamzin rafn. according to rafn, the script was optioned by producer marc samuelson and cinemanx about three weeks after her agent sent it out. it was then sent out to directors, some of whom rafn met. she said maccormick was one of her favourites and was "really glad" when the script was offered to him.


=== writing ===
tamzin rafn wrote the screenplay of albatross on weekends over the course of three months while working full-time during the weekdays.the film's recurring theme, one's desire to escape from something holding her back, is derived from rafn's personal experiences. rafn grew up in the quiet town of worthing on the south coast of england and spent her teenage years wanting to leave. according to her, "pushing the boundaries came as a result of that being an actuality in my teens. it just so turns out that being a nightmare comes naturally to me. and writing emilia was like writing a version of myself but adding characteristics to make it filmic and that meant giving her some tragedy and heart to explain her behaviour."rafn credited diablo cody as inspiration for her to write about her own experiences. cody began her foray into writing by penning a memoir about her career as a stripper. she later won an academy award for best original screenplay for the film juno. rafn said, "what i did know about though was naughty girls in seaside towns. i knew that because id been one and i always loved movies about people who misbehaved... so i sat down and i thought about everything i loved in movies. that list ran to: naughty girls, seaside towns, writers and scandalous behaviour. i then watched every movie that fitted that for me  the wonder boys, the squid and the whale, wish you were here, the door in the floor, thirteen."


=== casting ===
casting director shaheen baig reportedly resisted pressure to include major stars.the film marks jessica brown findlay's first starring role in a major production. she was reportedly cast before she began filming in the successful television series downton abbey. while auditioning for alice in wonderland, brown findlay found an agent who led her to the script of albatross. maccormick wanted "a girl who could tell someone to f*** off and die and for the audience to still feel they were actually quite charming" for the film's central role, emelia. brown findlay said she adored the role and "decided to be emelia both inside and outside the audition room." maccormick was shocked to find out that she was actually nothing like the character when the cast began filming in 2009. brown findlay said emelia and lady sybil, her role in downton abbey, are "both going to grow into strong women. they're finding out who they are and what they're going to be." she admitted the characters are "very different," and that emelia has "got that same guts that sybil has - just in a much more overtly obvious way, she's ballsy. she doesn't have a filter system - if she thinks something, she says it. she doesn't have that restraint that sybil has."brown findlay is close friends with co-star felicity jones, whom she met at auditions. jones was cast as the introverted beth. "i should probably say i was very different to her aged 17. i would sound a lot cooler. but i like the way beth is an observer," she said.sebastian koch's part as jonathan is only the second english-speaking role of the german actor's career, which spans more than two decades. of brown findlay, koch said "she started with this film, and did it wonderfully  just to see these first steps was wonderful for me, and perhaps to help and support her a bit. shes really brilliant in the film; shes emelia, exactly what the script wanted."


=== filming ===
albatross was filmed entirely on the isle of man, which was used to portray the film's setting in a fictional small coastal town somewhere on the mainland. among the locations used in the film were historic house ravencliffe near douglas head and peel harbour.  other venues included: the quay by castle rushen in castletown, the west coast at niarbyl, the graveyard  at st marks, and the lighthouse at the point of ayre.  the interview episode at "oxford" was filmed in the quadrangle and refectory of king williams college.
the isle's minister for economic development allan bell said the film showcases "the beauty and diversity of locations that the island has to offer film-makers... one of the many considerations that come into play when we are considering involvement in a film project is how well the script fits the natural locations of the island and in how many ways the island can benefit from any possible collaboration. albatross ticked all the boxes and we are thrilled to be associated with a film of such quality and appeal."the film was shot in 2009 and took six weeks to complete.
