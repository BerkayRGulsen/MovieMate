"chinese coffee" refers to a scene in which levine explains to manheim why he thinks a cup of coffee in chinatown restaurants is superior to any other because they use the best beans, brewed fresh in silex glass pots only, and they give you real cream.  chinese coffee is also a metaphor for the safety that levine feels when he is in one of these restaurants.
