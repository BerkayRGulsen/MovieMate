speaking to filmmaker magazine, araki referred to the film as being "very much about trying to live by your own rules...about achieving conventional happiness in an unconventional way." in terms of genre, he said "i wanted a sort of cary grant stylization. as in screwball comedy, the emotions are real, but there is also a kind of sheen to the performance."


== reception ==
splendor received mixed reviews from critics. it holds a ranking of 52/100 on review aggregator metacritic, and has a 58% on rotten tomatoes. the chicago reader described it as being "marvelously neutral toward a type of sexual and domestic relationship that's often exploited or overblown", and the austin chronicle stated that "there's a genuine, sparky chemistry between the three...and robertson, particularly, is luminous in her role." the daily news was less positive, saying that the film "seems more like a vapid sitcom made on a low budget" and summarising it as "meaningless, if perverted, fun." variety stated that, "though less violent and macabre than all of (araki's) previous movies, splendor is not exactly fresh, nor a radical point of departure...a seductively sensual picture that entices while it lasts but evaporates like an air bubble as soon as it is over."
