== plot ==
the story takes place in thomas hardy's wessex during the 1880s.
the events of the story are set in motion when a clergyman, parson tringham, has a chance conversation with john durbeyfield, a simple farmer. tringham is a local historian, and in the course of his research he has discovered the "durbeyfields" are descended from the d'urbervilles, a noble family whose lineage extends to the time of william the conqueror. the family lost its land and prestige when the male heirs died out. the parson thinks durbeyfield might like to know his origins as a passing historical curiosity.
durbeyfield soon becomes fixated upon the idea of using his noble lineage to better his family's fortunes. finding a wealthy family named d'urberville living nearby, he and his wife send their daughter tess to call on his presumed relations, and seek employment at the manor house. at the manor house lives alec d'urberville and his mother. tess is a beautiful girl, and alec d'urberville has an appetite for women. alec and his mother know they are no relation to tess, for their family name and coat of arms had been purchased. finding her naive, penniless and attractive, he sets about taking advantage of the situation. he tries to get her alone, and attempts to seduce her with strawberries and roses, but these efforts are parried by tess. in time, he rapes her.
tess returns home and soon discovers she is pregnant. she is angry with her mother for placing her at risk when she knew so little of the cruelness of the world. the baby is born sickly and dies. some time later, tess goes to a dairy farm to work as a milkmaid. she meets angel clare, an aspiring young farmer from a respectable family. he believes tess to be an unspoiled country girl, and completely innocent. the two fall in love, but tess does not reveal her previous relationship with alec until their wedding night. disillusioned and heartbroken by the news, angel rejects her.
deserted by her husband, tess meets alec d'urberville again. she at first angrily rebuffs his advances, but the death of her father puts the family in desperately hard times. facing starvation, eviction and homelessness, tess is compelled to resume her relationship with alec as his mistress to support her mother and siblings.
shortly afterwards, angel clare returns from travelling abroad. a disastrous missionary tour in brazil has ruined his health. humbled, and having had plenty of time to think, he feels remorse for his treatment of tess. he succeeds in tracking her down but leaves heartbroken when he finds her living with alec. tess realizes that going back to alec has ruined her chances of happiness with angel, and murders alec.
running away to find angel, tess is reconciled with him; he can finally accept and embrace her as his wife without passing moral judgment on her actions. they consummate their marriage, spending two nights of happiness together on the run from the law before tess is captured sleeping at stonehenge. an ending summary tells that she is convicted and hanged for murder.

== production ==
polanski was inspired to make the film by his wife sharon tate, who gave him a copy of tess of the d'urbervilles. she said it would make a great film and expressed interest in playing the part of tess. it was the last time polanski saw her alive, as she was departing back for america while he stayed on a while longer in europe to finish working on a film. she was murdered by the manson family on 9 august 1969 while he was away. the film is dedicated to her ("to sharon") at the beginning.
polanski wrote the screenplay in french with his usual collaborator grard brach, then it was translated and expanded by john brownjohn. the story line largely follows that of the book, although the role of the sexual predator alec d'urberville is toned down.costumes for the film were designed by anthony powell. he received his third academy award for this work.

polanski intended the film to reflect an ancient peasant culture, which he had seen in poland during world war ii after fleeing the krakw ghetto. the scenes also refer to the genre painting of the french artists georges de la tour of the 17th century and gustave courbet of the 19th century.during the third month of shooting, on 28 october 1978, the cinematographer geoffrey unsworth died of a heart attack. most of the scenes he had shot were exteriors that occur in the first half of the film. ghislain cloquet shot the remainder of the film, including most of the interior scenes. both unsworth and cloquet were nominated and won an academy award for best cinematography. cloquet alone was nominated for the csar award for cinematography, which he won.
