== plot ==
in 2013, alien monsters called kaiju emerge from an interdimensional portal called "the breach" at the bottom of the pacific ocean. in response, humanity builds massive robots called jaegers, each is co-piloted by two or more people, who share a mental link via a process called "drifting" to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.
in 2020, brothers yancy and raleigh becket pilot the jaeger gipsy danger to defend anchorage from a category-3 kaiju codenamed "knifehead". during the confrontation, the kaiju unexpectedly pierces the jaeger's armor, ripping out its left arm and half of its head, which pulls yancy out of the conn pod, killing him. raleigh, piloting the damaged jaeger solo, kills knifehead and walks gipsy back to shore by himself before collapsing. traumatized by the loss of his brother and the strain of drifting alone, raleigh quits the jaeger program. five years later, world leaders decide to cease funding for the jaeger program and replace it with coastal defense walls, since kaiju are appearing more frequently and jaegers are being destroyed as quickly as they are built. the remaining jaegers are relocated to hong kong under the command of marshal stacker pentecost, who plans to destroy the breach using a tactical nuclear weapon.
pentecost tracks down raleigh to a wall construction site to recruit him for the assault, though raleigh still remains traumatised by yancys death. travelling to the hong kong base, the shatterdome, raleigh is introduced to mako mori, the director of the jaeger's restoration program and pentecosts adoptive daughter. four jaegers remain in operation  the refurbished gipsy danger, the russian cherno alpha, chinese crimson typhoon, and the australian striker eureka, piloted by father and son herc and chuck hansen. to find a new co-pilot, raleigh participates in tryouts, deciding mako is "drift-compatible". during their first test, raleigh falls out of alignment reliving yancy's death, causing mako to become lost in the memory of a kaiju's attack on tokyo, nearly firing gipsys energy cannon. pentecost grounds both pilots.
pentecost consults kaiju experts newton geiszler and hermann gottlieb. hermann claims the breach will stabilise and the kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed. newton suggests attempting to drift with a kaiju's brain to learn more about them, but is dismissed by his colleagues. he attempts it regardless, discovering that kaiju are bioweapons grown by alien colonists. pentecost instructs newton to find black market dealer hannibal chau to obtain another kaiju brain to drift with it. newton realises the kaiju hive mind gained access to his brain, since drifting is a two-way link, and two new kaiju, leatherback and otachi, are sent simultaneously to find him.
all jaegers save gipsy danger are dispatched to intervene. the kaiju destroy crimson typhoon and cherno alpha, while leatherback paralyzes striker eureka with an emp blast. pentecost sends gipsy danger to help; it is the only jaeger powered by a nuclear reactor, while the others are digital. gipsy kills leatherback and otachi shortly after during her search for newton. newton and hannibal go to harvest otachis secondary brain, discovering she is pregnant. the infant kaiju bursts out, devours hannibal, before choking on its own umbilical cord. newton and hermann drift with the infants brain, discovering the breach only opens in the presence of a kaiju's dna.
pentecost reveals to raleigh he has terminal cancer due to piloting a first-generation jaeger, which lacked radiation shielding, the last time being in tokyo. two new kaiju are detected guarding the breach, prompting gipsy and the repaired striker, piloted by pentecost and chuck, to go ahead with the assault. approaching the breach, the jaegers are attacked by the kaiju, and a new "category five" kaiju, slattern, leading to striker being crippled. learning the truth from newton and hermann, pentecost and chuck decide to sacrifice striker while gipsy acts as the nuclear bomb to seal the breach. after striker self-destructs, gipsy slaughters the kaiju, riding slatterns corpse into the breach. raleigh removes mako from gipsy, manually causing gipsy to self-destruct, escaping before it explodes and seals the breach. raleigh and makos escape pods surface in the pacific ocean; they embrace as rescue helicopters arrive.


== cast ==

charlie hunnam as raleigh becket:  a washed-up former pilot called out of retirement by the pan pacific defense corps. on casting hunnam, del toro stated: "i saw him and i thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. and he was the kind of guy that i can relate to, as a male audience member i go, 'i like that guy. i would like to have a few beers with that guy' ... he has an earthy quality." describing the character, hunnam stated: "when you meet me, in the beginning of the story, i've suffered a giant loss. not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. and then, rinko and idris, and a couple other people, bring me out of retirement to try to help with this grand push. i think that journey is a very relatable one. everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." hunnam was also considered for the role of prince nuada in del toro's previous film, hellboy ii: the golden army. paul michael wyers plays raleigh as a child.
idris elba as marshal stacker pentecost:  raleigh's commanding officer in pan pacific defense corps and former jaeger pilot dying of radiation poisoning due to lax radiation shielding on the first jaeger models. on selecting elba, del toro stated: "this is a movie where i have had to deal with more dialogue than ever, and the way i cast the movie waswho do i want to hear say these things? who do i want charlie hunnam to go against? who can really tell charlie hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" in another interview, the director said: "i wanted to have idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, anglo, super hip marine that knows [everything]. i wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel the weight of the world on his shoulders. when i watched luther, that's the essence of the character ... luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. he's doing penance for all humanity ... idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. i wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." to prepare for the role, elba watched footage of politicians david cameron and barack obama, as well as russell crowe in gladiator and mel gibson in braveheart. del toro initially offered the role to tom cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.
rinko kikuchi as mako mori:  raleigh's co-pilot who lost her family in a kaiju attack and was adopted by pentecost. though mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the kaiju, pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. del toro stated: "i was very careful how i built the movie. one of the other things i decided was that i wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. she's not going to be a sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." noting that the other actors were exhausted and "destroyed physically" by filming in the intensive jaeger cockpit harnesses, del toro said: "the only one that didn't break was rinko kikuchi, the girl. she never complained ... i asked rinko her secret and she said 'i think of gummi bears and flowers.' i try to do that in my life now." mana ashida plays mako as a child.
charlie day as dr. newton 'newt' geiszler:  a scientist studying the kaiju. day stated: "certainly myself and burn gorman provide a little bit of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. but then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. so, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real ... the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." del toro gave geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a "big personality". according to the director, day was cast based on his performance in an episode of it's always sunny in philadelphia: "he comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. it was very funny, but he was coming from character. he was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. and i thought, 'this guy is great at shading and comedy.' there are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." trek buccino portrays newt as a child.
ron perlman as hannibal chau:  a black marketeer who makes a living dealing kaiju organs. perlman stated, "i actually think this character was designed to be played by another ethnicity other than myself. and somewhere along the way, [del toro] had the notion, 'wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' so, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. that added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character ... i'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. but a completely made-up persona ... which makes him even more full of shit. and i think that's the charm of the guythat he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." pacific rim marks perlman's fifth appearance in a del toro film. the director stated: "i think the moment you have a guy that is called hannibal chau and ron shows up, and he's from brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story ... that's all i need to know. if it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. but when ron comes in with that look, you can make your own story and it'll be as compelling as anything i can invent. you do a little weightlifting with the audience." the bird tattoos on chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. in the film, chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite szechuan restaurant in brooklyn. del toro drew inspiration from burt lancaster's performance in elmer gantry when writing the character.
robert kazinsky as chuck hansen: an australian jaeger pilot considered the finest soldier left in the resistance. he and his father herc pilot striker eureka, "the strongest and the fastest" jaeger with eleven kaiju kills, and make up the resistance's "go-to team". kazinsky, a fan of science-fiction, was initially drawn by the film's concept, "my immediate reaction was 'holy crap, that's cool.' in the hands of somebody else, you might sit there and go, 'well, this might be terrible,' but with del toro doing it, you kind of go, 'this is going to be amazing.'". reflecting on his experience in the film, kazinsky said in an interview, "the most fun i have ever had in my entire life was pacific rim, playing chuck was incredibly fun."
max martini as hercules "herc" hansen:  chuck's father and co-pilot. kazinsky stated martini hated the fact that he was cast as chuck's father, being only 13 years kazinsky's senior. however, kazinsky said they developed a bond while filming, "because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had ... the emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because i had grown to actually genuinely love max as a man and as a friend." kazinsky revealed that herc and chuck's pet bulldog was del toro's idea and said, "the dog's name was max, ironically, and we ended up using max for so many things. the story was that herc and chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." the role was originally written for ron perlman, but del toro decided the scenes between perlman's herc and hunnam's raleigh "might start to feel like sons of anarchy 2.0".
clifton collins jr. as tendo choi:  a jaeger technician. collins described his character as the "brains" behind the jaegers.
burn gorman as dr. hermann gottlieb:  a scientist studying the kaiju alongside geiszler. according to del toro, gottlieb is a "tweed-wearing, english, phlegmatic introvert that never leaves the lab". the modest gottlieb resents geiszler's arrogance and radical behavior; the duo echo the film's theme of incompatible people functioning together when the time comes. drew adkins portrays gottlieb as a child.
diego klattenhoff as yancy becket:  raleigh's older brother and co-pilot. klattenhoff joined the project to work with del toro. describing his character, klattentoff stated: "this is a guy who is looking out for his very eager, younger brother and they were enabled with this gift that gave them the opportunity to kind of save the world. or help, at least." tyler stevenson plays yancy as a child.additional jaeger pilots include charles luu, lance luu and mark luu as the wei tang triplets (china), and robert maillet and heather doerksen as sasha and alexis kaidanovsky (russia). joe pingue portrays captain merrit, the captain of a fishing boat caught in a battle between jaeger and kaiju. santiago segura plays an aide to hannibal chau. brad william henke and larry joe campbell portray members of an alaskan construction team that raleigh joins after retiring from the pan pacific defense corps. robin thomas, julian barnes, and david richmond-peck portray u.n. representatives from the united states, great britain, and canada, respectively. sebastian pigott appears as a jaeger engineer and joshua peace appears as an officer, jonathan foxon appears as a frantic civilian. david fox plays an old man on a beach, while jane watson portrays raleigh and yancy's mother in a flashback sequence. producer thomas tull makes a cameo appearance. ellen mclain makes a vocal appearance as the a.i of the gipsy danger, a nod to her role as glados in the portal game series.


== themes ==
in the film, a jaeger's neural load is too much for a single pilot to handle alone, meaning they must first be psychically linked to another pilota concept called "drifting". when pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate knowledge of each other's memories and feelings, and have no choice but to accept them; del toro found this concept's dramatic potential compelling. the director expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real life:

the pilots' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that we're all together in the same robot [in life] ... either we get along or we die. i didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. the idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.
del toro acknowledged this message's simplicity, but said he would have liked to have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. the film's ten primary characters all have "little arcs" conducive to this idea; del toro stated: "i think that's a great message to give kids ... 'that guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? that's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' that's life ... we can only be complete when we work together." the director noted that hellboy and the devil's backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.the film centers on the relationship between becket and mori, but it is not a love story in a conventional sense. both are deeply damaged human beings who have decided to suppress their respective traumas. while learning to pilot their jaeger, they undergo a process of "opening up", gaining access to each other's thoughts, memories and secrets. their relationship is necessarily one of respect and "perfect trust". hunnam commented that the film is "a love story without a love story. it's about all of the necessary elements of love without arriving at love itself". both becket and mori have suffered profound personal tragedies; one of the script's central ideas is that two damaged people can metaphorically "become one", with their figurative missing pieces connecting almost like a puzzle. del toro emphasized the characters' emotional intimacy by filming their training fight scene the way he would a sex scene.del toro, a self-described pacifist, avoided what he termed "car commercial aesthetics" or "army recruitment video aesthetics", and gave the characters western ranks including "marshal" and "ranger" rather than military ranks such as "captain", "major" or "general". the director stated: "i avoided making any kind of message that says war is good. we have enough firepower in the world." del toro wanted to break from the mass death and destruction featured in contemporary blockbuster films, and made a point of showing the streets and buildings being evacuated before kaiju attacks, ensuring that the destruction depicted is "completely remorseless". the director stated:

i don't want people being crushed. i want the joy that i used to get seeing godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank ... what i think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. there is a global anxiety about how fragile the status quo is and the safety of citizens, but in my mindhonestlythis film is in another realm. there is no correlation to the real world. there is no fear of a copycat kaiju attack because a kaiju saw it on the news and said, "i'm going to destroy seattle." in my case, i'm picking up a tradition. one that started right after world war ii and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for japan to heal the wounds of that war. and it's integral for a kaiju to rampage in the city.
writing for the los angeles review of books, wai chee dimock connected the film's central theme of togetherness to its recurring image of missing shoes, stating the "utopian dream" driving the characters is

that puny humans like us could be "together"not only in the specific neural melding that must take place between the two jaeger co-pilots but also, more generally speaking, in a fractal web of resemblance, filling the world with copies of ourselves at varying orders of magnitude and with varying degrees of re-expression, beginning with the shoes on our feet.


== production ==


=== development ===
in february 2006, it was reported that guillermo del toro would direct travis beacham's fantasy screenplay killing on carnival row, but the project never materialized. beacham conceived pacific rim the following year. while walking on the beach near santa monica pier, the screenwriter imagined a giant robot and a giant monster fighting to the death. "they just sort of materialized out of the fog, these vast, godlike things." he later conceived the idea that each robot had two pilots, asking "what happens when one of those people dies?" deciding this would be "a story about loss, moving on after loss, and dealing with survivor's guilt", beacham commenced writing the film. on may 28, 2010, it was reported that legendary pictures had purchased beacham's detailed 25-page film treatment, now titled pacific rim.on july 28, 2010, it was reported that del toro would next direct an adaptation of h. p. lovecraft's at the mountains of madness for universal studios, with james cameron producing. when del toro met with legendary pictures to discuss the possibility of collaborating with them on a film, he was intrigued by beacham's treatmentstill a "very small pitch" at this point. del toro struck a deal with legendary: while directing at the mountains of madness, he would produce and co-write pacific rim; because of the films' conflicting production schedules, he would direct pacific rim only if at the mountains of madness were cancelled. tom cruise was attached to star in the lovecraft adaptation.on march 7, 2011, it was reported that universal would not proceed with at the mountains of madness because del toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and r rating. the director later reflected, "when it happened, this has never happened to me, but i actually cried that weekend a lot. i don't want to sound like a puny soul, but i really was devastated. i was weeping for the movie." the project collapsed on a friday, and del toro signed to direct pacific rim the following monday.del toro spent a year working with beacham on the screenplay, and is credited as co-writer. he introduced ideas he had always wished to see in the genre, such as a kaiju birth and a kaiju attack seen from a child's perspective. the script also received an uncredited rewrite from neil cross, who previously created the idris elba-starring drama series luther and wrote the del toro-produced horror film mama. patrick melton and marcus dunstan were enlisted to perform uncredited rewrites when their spec script monstropolis caught the filmmaker's attention. drew pearce also carried out uncredited work on the script.


=== filming ===
filming began on november 14, 2011, and continued in toronto into april 2012. del toro gave an update after the second week on filming finished. the film was referred to as silent seas and still seas during production.del toro had never shot a film in less than 115 days, but had only 103 to shoot pacific rim. in order to achieve this, del toro scheduled a splinter unit that he could direct early in the day, before main unit, and on his off-days. the director worked 17 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, for much of the schedule. del toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing "looser" movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: "everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later. i do not delegate anything. some people like it, some people don't, but it has to be done that way."the film was shot using red epic cameras. at first guillermo del toro decided not to shoot or convert the film to 3d, as the effect would not work due to the sheer size of the film's robots and monsters, explaining

i didn't want to make the movie 3d because when you have things that big ... the thing that happens naturally, you're looking at two buildings lets say at 300 feet [away], if you move there is no parallax. they're so big that, in 3d, you barely notice anything no matter how fast you move ... to force the 3d effects for robots and monsters that are supposed to be big you are making their [perspective] miniaturized, making them human scale.
it was later announced that the film would be converted to 3d, with the conversion taking 40 weeks longer than most. del toro said: "what can i tell you? i changed my mind. i'm not running for office. i can do a romney."del toro cut approximately an hour of material from the film. the unused footage explored the characters and their arcs in greater detail, but the director felt it was necessary to strike a balance, stating: "we cannot pretend this is ibsen with monsters and giant robots. i cannot pretend i'm doing a profound reflection on mankind." each character's arc was edited down to its minimal requirements. the director wanted to keep the film around two hours, particularly for younger viewers. alejandro gonzlez irritu and alfonso cuarn helped with the editing; irritu removed ten minutes of footage, while cuarn removed "a few minutes" and rearranged several scenes. irritu and cuarn receive a "special thanks" in the film's end credits, as do james cameron and david cronenberg.


=== design ===

del toro envisioned pacific rim as an earnest, colorful adventure story, with an "incredibly airy and light feel", in contrast to the "super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie". the director focused on "big, beautiful, sophisticated visuals" and action that would satisfy an adult audience, but has stated his "real hope" is to introduce the kaiju and mecha genres to a generation of children. while the film draws heavily on these genres, it avoids direct references to previous works. del toro intended to create something original but "madly in love" with its influences, instilled with "epic beauty" and "operatic grandeur". the ending credits dedicate the film to ray harryhausen and ishir honda, who helped to establish the giant monster genre with films such as the beast from 20,000 fathoms and godzilla, respectively.the film was to honor the kaiju and mecha genres while creating an original stand-alone film, something "conscious of the heritage, but not a pastiche or an homage or a greatest hits of everything". the director made a point of starting from scratch, without emulating or referencing any previous examples of those genres. he cautioned his designers not to turn to films like gamera, godzilla, or the war of the gargantuas for inspiration, stating: "i didn't want to be postmodern, or referential, or just belong to a genre. i really wanted to create something new, something madly in love with those things. i tried to bring epic beauty to it, and drama and operatic grandeur." rather than popular culture, he drew inspiration from works of art such as the colossus and george bellows's boxing paintings. the film's designers include wayne barlowe (who is the primary designer of the kaiju), oscar chichoni, monster sculptors david meng and simon lee, and hellboy ii and the hobbit designer francisco ruiz velasco. del toro has acknowledged that some designs created for his cancelled at the mountains of madness adaptation may have been used in pacific rim.approximately one hundred kaiju and one hundred jaegers were designed, but only a fraction of these appear in the film; every week the filmmakers would "do an american idol" and vote for the best. in designing kaiju, the film's artists frequently drew inspiration from nature rather than other works. the director commented: "kaijus are essentially outlandish in a way, but on the other hand they come sort of in families: you've got the reptilian kaiju, the insect kaiju, the sort of crustacean kaiju ... so to take an outlandish design and then render it with an attention to real animal anatomy and detail is interesting." del toro avoided making the kaiju too similar to any earth creatures, instead opting to make them otherworldly and alien. del toro called the film's kaiju "weapons", stating that they are "the cleaning crew, the cats sent into the warehouse to clean out the mice." certain design elements are shared by all the kaiju; this is intended to suggest that they are connected and were designed for a similar purpose. each kaiju was given a vaguely humanoid silhouette to echo the man-in-suit aesthetic of early japanese kaiju films. while del toro's other films feature ancient or damaged monsters, the kaiju lack scars or any evidence of prior culture, indicating that they are engineered creations rather than the result of an evolutionary system.knifehead, the first kaiju to appear in the film, is a tribute to the plodding kaiju of 1960s japanese films, and is intended to look almost like a man in a rubber suit; its head was inspired by that of a goblin shark. leatherback, the bouncer-like kaiju which spews electro-magnetic charges, is a favorite of del toro, who conceived it as a "brawler with this sort of beer belly"; the lumbering movements of gorillas were used as a reference. the kaiju otachi homages the dragons of chinese mythology. the director called it a "swiss army knife of a kaiju"; with almost 20 minutes of screen time, it was given numerous features so the audience would not tire of it. the creature moves like a komodo dragon in water, sports multiple jaws and an acid-filled neck sack, and unfurls wings when necessary. it is also more intelligent than the other kaiju, employing eagle-inspired strategies against the jaegers. onibaba, the kaiju that orphans mako mori, resembles a fusion of a japanese temple and a crustacean. slattern, the largest kaiju, is distinguished by its extremely long neck and "half-horn, half-crown" head, which del toro considered both demonic and majestic.gipsy danger, the american jaeger, was based on the shape of new york city's art deco buildings, such as the chrysler building and the empire state building, but infused with john wayne's gunslinger gait and hip movements. cherno alpha, the russian jaeger, was based on the shape and paint patterns of a t-series russian tank, combined with a giant containment silo to give the appearance of a walking nuclear power plant with a cooling tower on its head. crimson typhoon, the three-armed chinese jaeger, is piloted by triplets and resembles a "medieval little warrior"; its texture evokes chinese lacquered wood with golden edges. striker eureka, the australian jaeger, is likened by del toro to a land rover; the most elegant and masculine jaeger, it has a jutting chest, a camouflage paint scheme recalling the australian outback, and the bravado of its pilots.the film's costumes were designed by shane mahan and kate hawley, who spent several months on the costumes of the jaeger pilots. the russian pilot suits are old-fashioned and echo cosmonaut space suits.


=== visual effects ===
industrial light & magic was chosen to create the visual effects for pacific rim. del toro hired oscar winners john knoll and hal t. hickel, both known for their work on the star wars prequel trilogy and the pirates of the caribbean films. legacy effects co-owner shane mahan, known for creating the armored suits for iron man, was tasked with building the suits, helmets and conn-pods. oscar winner clay pinney, known for his work on independence day and star trek, was also brought on board. hybride technologies, a division of ubisoft, and rodeo fx also contributed to the visual effects.

del toro conceived the film as an operatic work:

that was one of the first words i said to the entire team at ilm. i said, "this movie needs to be theatrical, operatic, romantic." we used a lot of words not usually associated with high-tech blockbusters ... we went for a very, very, very, very saturated color palette for the battle for hong kong. i kept asking john to tap into his inner mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges. the classic japanese woodblock print the great wave off kanagawa by hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; del toro recalled, "i would say 'give me a hokusai wave' ... we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically." the director asked that knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: "it's pretty unorthodox to do that, but i think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, not something you would associate with a big sci-fi action movie." del toro considers the film's digital water its most exciting visual effect: "the water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. we agreed on making the water become almost another character. we would time the water very precisely. i'd say 'get out of the wave [on this frame].'"the film also features extensive miniature effect shots provided by 32ten studios, under the supervision of ilm vfx producer susan greenhow and ilm vfx supervisors john knoll and lindy dequattro. shot using red epic cameras on 3d rigs, the scenes produced by 32ten involved the creation of a quarter-scale office building interior which was destroyed by the fist of a jaeger robot which was on a separate pneumatically controlled rig, as well as a sequence which depicted several rows of seats in a soccer stadium being blown apart as a jaeger lands in the stadium, which was created by using quarter-scale seats blown apart by air cannons. additionally 32ten provided several practical elements for ilm's compositing team including dust clouds, breaking glass and water effects.


== music ==
