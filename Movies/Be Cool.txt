== plot ==
chili palmer, restless after years of filmmaking, enters the music industry after witnessing the russian mob execute his friend tommy athens, owner of a record company. chili offers to help tommy's widow, edie athens, manage the failing business, which owes $300,000 to hip-hop producer sin lasalle.
chili is impressed by singer linda moon and helps free her from contractual obligations to nick carr and raji, who has a gay samoan bodyguard named elliot, an aspiring actor and the butt of carr and raji's homophobic jokes. carr and raji hire a hitman, joe "loop" lupino to kill chili before he can save edie's company by arranging a live performance for linda along with steven tyler and aerosmith.
lasalle demands payment of the $300,000, but agrees to give chili a few days to get the money plus the vig. when the russians attempt to kill chili, joe loop mistakenly kills ivan argianiyev, the russian mob's hitman. carr is furious about the mistake and demands that raji talks to loop at once. raji then kills loop with a metal baseball bat after loop "disrespects" him.
carr then tries to trick chili by handing him a pawn ticket, claiming that linda's contract is being held at a pawn shop owned by the russians. chili being much smarter than carr anticipated, has edie give the ticket to the police, who pay the russians a visit. raji and elliot set up lasalle by making him believe that carr tricked chili in giving him the $300,000 to get linda's contract. lasalle and the dubmd confront carr in his office, as do bulkin and his men. insulted by bulkin's racist remarks, lasalle kills him.
chili squeezes in a dance scene with edie (a nod to the "twist contest" scene in pulp fiction), celebrating as linda moon gets to make her appearance with aerosmith in concert. based on linda's success in that concert, chili assuages lasalle by making him her producer.
but carr is not accepting any deal, so he makes raji put elliot to kill chili. by assuring elliot that he can help his acting career, chili befriends him. after learning that chili had gotten him an audition for a nicole kidman film, elliot turns on raji, who had erased the message on his answering machine. for all his smooth talking and flamboyant wardrobe, raji finds himself in a firework conflagration which roasts him live on camera. carr is arrested on murder charges when chili makes sure he is caught with the bat used to kill joe loop, via another pawn ticket.
at the mtv video music awards, linda wins the awards for best new artist and video of the year. during her acceptance speech, she thanks edie, sin and chili. edie and chili leave the award ceremony. and as chili drives off, he passes a billboard revealing that elliot is the co-star of a new movie with nicole kidman.
