=== critical reception ===
rajeev masand of cnn-ibn rated it 2/5: "sorely lacking in drama and genuine humour, money hai toh honey is mind-numbingly dull because theres no conflict or plot progression, and everything seems to fall into place too conveniently, which even ruins the amazing comedy at the first half!"
mayank shekhar of hindustan times rated it 2.5/5: "scenes may well be dull and weak in parts. and they are. but for a comedy film, it needs to have some more sense-of-humor."raja sen of rediff rated it 1.5/5: "this is, first and foremost, a tacky film. the tastelessness flowing right down into the script, however, makes for a very different league of disaster."taran adarsh of bollywood hungama rated it 2/5: "money hai toh honey hai is a poor show. watch the first half and laugh your total head-off, but at the second half, try to enjoy a damp squib!"nikhat kazmi of the times of india gave it the highest rating it got: 3.5/5: "money hai toh honey made a complete laugh-riot in the first part, but soon after the interval a lot of drama and romance jumps in which is totally something you don't need in a comedy movie, it needed a much smarter script to keep the laughter ringing."
