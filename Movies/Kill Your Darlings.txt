== plot ==
in 1944, poet allen ginsberg (daniel radcliffe) wins a place at columbia university in new york city. he arrives as a very inexperienced freshman, but soon runs into lucien carr (dane dehaan), an unruly character who holds strong anti-establishment beliefs.
ginsberg discovers that carr only manages to stay at columbia thanks to a professor working as a janitor, david kammerer (michael c. hall), who writes all of carr's term papers for him. kammerer's character is established to have a predatory relationship with carr, still being in love with carr, and is revealed to be pressuring carr for sexual favors in exchange for assuring that he cannot be expelled.
as ginsberg spent more time with carr, he soon meets william s. burroughs (ben foster), who is far into drug experimentation, and the writer jack kerouac (jack huston), who was a sailor at that time and expelled from columbia. together, these ambitious people decided to start a new literary movement named the new vision as a rebellion towards laws, institutions and ginsberg and carr's lawful professor steeves. as ginsberg spirals into the lifestyle of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes along with his new found friends, he slowly starts developing romantic feelings for carr.
carr tells kammerer he is done with him and recruits ginsberg to write his term papers instead. kammerer, in retaliation, puts kerouac's cat into the oven only for kerouac to discover and rescue it in the middle of the night.
after a while, kerouac and carr attempt to run off and join the merchant marine together, hoping to go to paris.
there is a confrontation between carr and kammerer, during which kammerer is killed by stabbing (and perhaps also by drowning). carr is arrested, and asks ginsberg to write his deposition for him. ginsberg is at first reluctant to help the unstable carr, but after digging up more crucial evidence on kammerer and his past relationship, he writes a piece entitled "the night in question". the piece describes a more emotional event, in which carr kills kammerer who outright tells him to after being threatened with the knife, devastated by this final rejection. carr rejects the "fictional" story, and begs a determined ginsberg not to reveal it to anybody, afraid that it will ruin him in the ensuing trial.
from carr's mother, it is revealed that kammerer was the first person to seduce carr, when he was much younger and lived in chicago. after the trial, carr testified that the attack took place only because kammerer was a sexual predator, and that carr killed him in self-defense. carr is not convicted of murder and receives only a short sentence for manslaughter.
ginsberg then submits "the night in question" as his final term paper. on the basis of that shocking piece of prose, ginsberg is faced with possible expulsion from columbia. either he must be expelled or he must embrace establishment values. he chooses the former, but is forced to leave his typescript behind. a week or two later he receives the typescript in the mail with an encouraging letter from his professor telling him to pursue his writing.

=== critical reaction ===
as of june 2020, kill your darlings holds a 76% approval rating on rotten tomatoes, based on 152 reviews with an average rating of 6.59/10. the website's critical consensus reads, "bolstered by the tremendous chemistry between daniel radcliffe and dane dehaan, kill your darlings casts a vivid spotlight on an early chapter in the story of the beat generation." on metacritic, the film had an average score of 65 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating "generally favorable" reviews. the film earned $1,030,064 in limited release.the daily telegraph granted the film a score of three out of five stars, stating that, "unlike walter salles's recent adaptation of on the road, which embraced the beat philosophy with a wide and credulous grin, kill your darlings is inquisitive about the movement's worth, and the genius of its characters is never assumed". reviewing kill your darlings after its showing at the 2013 sundance film festival, critic damon wise of the guardian lauded the film for being "the real deal, a genuine attempt to source the beginning of america's first true literary counterculture of the 20th century". kill your darlings, wrote wise, "creates a true sense of energy and passion, for once eschewing the clacking of typewriter keys to show artists actually talking, devising, and ultimately daring each other to create and innovate. and though it begins as a murder-mystery, kill your darlings may be best described as an intellectual moral maze, a story perfectly of its time and yet one that still resonates today." wise awarded the film four out of five stars. justin chang of variety wrote, "a mysterious beat generation footnote is fleshed out with skilled performances, darkly poetic visuals and a vivid rendering of 1940s academia in kill your darlings. directed with an assured sense of style that pushes against the narrow confines of its admittedly fascinating story, john krokidas' first feature feels adventurous yet somewhat hemmed-in as it imagines a vortex of jealousy, obsession and murder that engulfed allen ginsberg, william s. burroughs and jack kerouac in the early days of their literary revolution."


=== historical inaccuracies or questionable assertions ===
ginsberg's "long-time confidant and secretary, head of the allen ginsberg trust," bob rosenthal, argues that the film is "a superb evocation of young college students in the midst of world war ii finding their unique means of expression in the world." however, he states, it also contains a number of inaccuracies: "the large fabrications in the film are not so worrisome as the small ones. in any case, when the truth is stepped on and the nuance of truth is denied, the message becomes moribund." caleb carr went on to describe kammerer as a sexual predator 14 years older than lucien carr, who first met lucien when the latter was pubescent and had repeatedly taken advantage of the younger man's naivete and desperation for a strong male influence after being abandoned by his natural father. furthermore, kerouac, who wanted only platonic friendship from lucien, provoked the jealousy of kammerer. in contrast, according to jack kerouac's biographer dennis mcnally's account, lucien carr had always insisted, which william burroughs (a childhood friend of kammerer in st. louis) believed, that he never had sex with kammerer.
