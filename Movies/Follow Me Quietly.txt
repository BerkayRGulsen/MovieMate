a mysterious killer, known only as "the judge", kills anyone he considers worthless and immoral. lieutenant harry grant (william lundigan) is assigned to track him down. with just a handful of clues, grant constructs a faceless dummy to help his men conduct their investigation. meanwhile a persistent young female reporter (dorothy patrick) for a tabloid magazine is dogging grant for a story on the killings, much to his annoyance.
police finally break the case after receiving an important clue, the significance of which they realize only after the reporter explains it to them. finally, after cornering the killer during a chase on the catwalks of a refinery, the killer is revealed to be a middle-aged man whose cruel disposition and unattractive appearance lead him to become "the judge".

== reception ==
the new york times was dismissive of the film and wrote, "there is no intelligent reason why anyone should heed the proposal of follow me quietly...[f]or this utterly senseless little thriller is patently nothing more than a convenient one-hour time-killer between performances of the eight-act vaudeville bill."  reviewing it on dvd, gene triplett of the oklahoman wrote, "[t]his obscure gem packs a remarkable amount of thrills and dramatic weight into a mere 59 minutes".  paul mavis of dvd talk rated it 4.5/5 stars and called it a "strange, unsettling film noir mystery, with a disturbing subtext".
