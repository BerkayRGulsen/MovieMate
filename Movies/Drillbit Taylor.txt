one morning as his mother is driving him to school, ronnie sees drillbit taking a shower at the beach; his mother reveals that he is homeless. filkins finds the boys and punches drillbit. later, at wade's house, they catch drillbit's homeless friends stealing everything in sight, leaving the house completely empty. drillbit confesses that his real name is bob and he went awol from the u.s. army and his name was drillbit because he hurt his pinky finger in high school with a drillbit. the boys fire drillbit, who later recovers all of wade's possessions and places them back before wade's parents return home. unfortunately, the boys accidentally let slip about drillbit. their parents take things up with the principal, who contacts the police. filkins plays innocent and charms all the adults; filkins continues to ridicule the boys after drillbit's disappearance. tensions finally burst when filkins interrupts wade's attempt to ask his crush, brooke nguyen, out. without realizing what he was doing, wade challenges filkins to a fight. after ryan insults emmit, he refuses to help them.
wade and ryan arrive at filkins' house, where he is hosting a party; initially the duo knock him down, but he soon overpowers them. ronnie shows up to help filkins against them. emmit, who has a change of heart, comes to their aid and for a while causes quite a lot of pain to filkins, and almost defeats him; but ronnie knocks him out while he is trying to break filkins' leg. drillbit shows up and filkins punches him. drillbit refuses to fight back until it is revealed filkins is not a minor (he's 18, therefore, he's not really emancipated). upon learning this, drillbit quickly begins fighting to defend the freshmen. he is about to attack ronnie, but he is spared when he reveals he's only 17. within minutes, the police arrive and drillbit flees for fear of prosecution. filkins then throws a samurai sword at the boys as retaliation, but drillbit catches it. he saves them, at the cost of half of his pinkie finger in the process. ronnie reveals to the police that filkins had bullied him into being his accomplice when they interview him.
filkins is arrested and shipped off to hong kong to be with his parents as an alternative to being sent to prison for breaking several underage drinking laws. wade, with renewed confidence, asks brooke out and she accepts, while ryan finally accepts emmit, and declares him a friend. drillbit is taken to jail, but ends up being released within three weeks. he is reunited with lisa and the boys and is soon employed at their school as a nurse. a post-credits scene shows a student entering the nurse's office telling drillbit he received bruises from being beaten up. drillbit then tells him to give the name of the student, assuring he'll be safer from then on.

== marketing ==
marketing for the movie included television promos and coming attractions previews, but actor owen wilson did not conduct any interviews to promote the film. instead, paramount pictures had wilson record introductions for fox's sunday night primetime shows such as the simpsons, american dad!, king of the hill, family guy, and unhitched. the character of drillbit was also featured as a "superstar" on the raw page of wwe.com for a period of time. wilson's publicist said his availability was limited due to filming marley & me.
john horn and gina piccalo of the los angeles times wrote that the reason for wilson's limited promotional schedule was due to studio executives being worried that interviewers would bring up wilson's hospitalization for severe depression in the summer of 2007.
