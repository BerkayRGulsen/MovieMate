== plot ==
in the 1880s, crown prince rudolf of austria (sharif) clashes with his father, emperor franz joseph i of austria (mason) and his mother empress elisabeth (gardner), over implementing progressive policies for their country. rudolf soon feels he is a man born at the wrong time in a country that does not realize the need for social reform. the prince of wales (robertson justice), later to become britain's king edward vii, provides comic relief.
rudolf finds refuge from a loveless marriage with princess stphanie (parisy) by taking a mistress, baroness maria vetsera (deneuve). their untimely death at mayerling, the imperial family's hunting lodge, is cloaked in mystery, but the film's ending suggests the two lovers made a suicide pact when they decided they could not live in a world without love or prospects for peace.
