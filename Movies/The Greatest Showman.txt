== plot ==
as a child, p. t. barnum and his tailor father, philo, work for the hallett family. barnum and hallett's daughter charity, grow up together and eventually fall in love. when charity attends finishing school, they write to each other, eventually marrying and raising two daughters, caroline and helen, in new york city. they live a humble life; though charity is happy, barnum craves more. (a million dreams)
barnum loses his shipping clerk job when the company goes bankrupt. he later secures a bank loan, deceptively using his former employer's lost ships as "collateral". he opens barnum's american museum in downtown manhattan which features various wax figures. ticket sales are slow, so his children suggest showcasing something "alive". barnum adds "freak" performers, such as bearded lady lettie lutz. this garners higher attendance, but also protests and poor reviews from well-known critic james gordon bennett. (come alive)
barnum renames his venture, "barnum's circus" and recruits playwright phillip carlyle to help generate publicity (the other side). phillip is mesmerized by the african american trapeze artist, anne wheeler, but he hides his feelings. while touring abroad, phillip arranges for barnum and his troupe to meet queen victoria. barnum persuades famed swedish singer jenny lind to tour america, with him as her manager. lind's american debut is a success. during her song, phillip's parents see him and anne holding hands (never enough). as barnum gains favor with aristocratic patrons, he distances himself from his troupe, advising them to work without him. dejected, they decide to stand against local harassers (this is me).
when phillip and anne attend the theater together, they run into phillip's parents. they chastise him for "parading around with the help". phillip tries to convince anne that they can be together, but she disagrees, saying they will never be accepted socially (rewrite the stars). as barnum takes lind on a u.s. tour, charity, who stays home with their daughters, feels isolated from her husband (tightrope). while on tour, lind becomes romantically attracted to barnum. when he rebuffs her, she threatens to quit and later retaliates with a surprise kiss at the end of her last show, which is photographed by the press.
barnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between protesters and the troupe. phillip runs into the burning building, believing anne is inside. he suffers serious injuries before barnum rescues him. barnum learns the culprits have been caught and that lind has canceled her tour after her and barnum's "scandal". barnum's mansion is foreclosed upon and charity takes their daughters to her parents' home.
devastated, barnum retreats to a local bar. his troupe finds him there and say that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family. inspired, he resolves to build a new show and not let ambition rule him (from now on). phillip awakens in a hospital with anne by his side, while barnum and charity reunite. (rewrite the stars: reprise).
the recovering phillip offers his share of the profits to help barnum rebuild the circus in exchange for becoming a full partner, which barnum readily accepts. to economize, barnum transforms the enterprise into an open-air tent circus. the revamped circus is a huge success and barnum has phillip oversee daily operations so he can spend more time with his family. in the last scene, barnum leaves the circus early and arrives on an elephant to watch his daughters' ballet recital with his wife (the greatest show).

ask first-time director michael gracey, who cut his teeth on commercials and music videos without ever mastering the crucial knack of building snippets of musical comedy and drama into a satisfying whole." justin chang of the los angeles times wrote that the film's failures "are rooted in something deeper: a dispiriting lack of faith in the audience's intelligence, and a dawning awareness of its own aesthetic hypocrisy. you've rarely seen a more straight-laced musical about the joys of letting your freak flag fly."the film has been criticized for whitewashing barnum's life and his perpetuation of human zoos as a form of entertainment.
