== reception ==
cairo road received a reasonably positive review from the new york times, who called it an "... unpretentious and consistently sensible little film... british restraint and taste not only have saved the day but succeeded in dignifying a battered subject... this routine picture has some sterling ingredients."the critic from variety said "action moves slowly in the first half and much of the story is veiled so as to obscure the plot. however, it winds up with a meaty climax."in a recent review by trevor johnston, time out noted, cairo road was, "... a workaday thriller, whose makers actually took the rouble to go to cairo and port said to shoot it. twenty-something harvey makes an early appearance as inspector portman's bumbling, keen-as-mustard assistant."
