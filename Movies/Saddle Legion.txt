== notes ==
according to film scholar tom stempel, malone was "the most interesting actress" to appear in a tim holt western:

the other women in the b westerns tended to be cute rather than sexy, but malone's look and voice were sex personified. so when chito flirts with her ann, malone is way beyond that kind of b western cuteness ... malone's sexual presence upsets the usual dynamics of the b westerns, and the filmmakers may have realized that malone's ann would have eaten martin's chito alive ... [in the final scene] as he and tim leave to take the cattle to market, chito says to ann, "you make sure you wait until i come back." since the end of the holt westerns usually involved chito running or riding away from girl who wants to marry him, the ending of saddle legion is a little more adult.
