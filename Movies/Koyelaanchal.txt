things get a bit difficult to handle for saryu bhan singh when an upright district collector nisheeth kumar takes charge of the region and starts asking him questions that no one dared ask him before. caught amidst labor revolts & naxal uprisings, the last thing saryu bhan singh wanted was to make enemies with the top government officer of his region. he sends his most lethal human weapon, karua to scare nisheeth kumar off to silence.
