halloween is a 2007 american slasher film written, directed, and produced by rob zombie. the film is a remake/reimagining of the 1978 horror film of the same name and the ninth installment in the halloween franchise. the film stars tyler mane as the adult michael myers, malcolm mcdowell as dr. sam loomis, scout taylor-compton as laurie strode, and daeg faerch as the young michael myers. rob zombie's "reimagining" follows the premise of john carpenter's original, with michael myers stalking laurie strode and her friends on halloween night. zombie's film tries to go deeper into the character's psyche and answer the question of what drove him to kill people, whereas in carpenter's original film michael did not have an explicit reason for killing.
working from carpenter's advice to "make [the film] his own", zombie chose to develop the film as both an origin story and a remake, allowing for more original content than simply re-filming the same scenes. despite mixed reviews, the film, which cost $15 million to make, went on to gross $80.3 million worldwide in unadjusted u.s. dollars. zombie followed the film with a sequel, halloween ii, in 2009.


== plot ==
on halloween in haddonfield, illinois, having already exhibited signs of psychopathic tendencies, ten-year-old michael myers murders a school bully, his older sister judith, her boyfriend steve haley and his mother's abusive boyfriend ronnie white. he only spares his infant sister. after one of the longest trials in the state's history, michael is found guilty of first-degree murder and sent to smith's grove sanitarium under the care of child psychologist dr. samuel loomis. michael initially cooperates with loomis and his mother deborah visits him regularly. over the following year, michael becomes dissociative, fixating on papier-mch masks and withdraws from everyone around him, even his mother. when michael kills a nurse as deborah is leaving from one of her visits, she is unable to handle the situation and commits suicide.
for the next fifteen years, michael continues making his masks and not speaking to anyone. loomis, having continued to treat michael over the years,  attempts to move forward with his life and closes michael's case. later, michael escapes from smith's grove, killing the guards and hospital staff in the process. he then kills a truck driver for his clothes and makes his way back to haddonfield. on halloween, michael arrives at his now-abandoned childhood home, where he recovers the kitchen knife and halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister.

== production ==
after the release of halloween: resurrection, there were various ideas on how to proceed with a ninth installment. after the release of freddy vs. jason in 2003, dimension films attempted to produce a crossover with the hellraiser franchise featuring pinhead and the cenobites. one of the pitches involved a young michael myers opening the lament configuration and being possessed with samhain fleeing from hell, providing the source of his murderousness and invincibility; the remainder of the film would have involved the cenobites pursuing him. according to doug bradley, clive barker agreed to write a script while john carpenter was being considered to direct. bradley said that barker "wasnt interested in a mano-a-mano confrontation. he was interested in finding the places where the hellraiser and halloween landscapes might have crossed over" and that he envisioned michael myers as a "a sadomasochistic sexual pervert and serial killer which would be enough to pique pinheads interest." the project was ultimately cancelled after 52 percent of respondents to an online poll disapproved of the project and moustapha akkad was not interested.akkad continued to try to develop a sequel. one script from 2004, titled halloween: retribution, would have begun with michael killing busta rhymes's character freddie harris and involved laurie strode's son john tate and sheriff leigh brackett plotting to kill michael myers in revenge for her death in the previous film; the film would have ended with tate drowning michael in a frozen lake but implying that he would take his place as a murderous killer. another prospective screenplay written by jake wade wall was halloween: the missing years, which would have been a prequel centered around michael myers returning to smith's grove sanitarium in the early 1980s during the events of halloween iii: season of the witch, with flashbacks revealing details about his childhood at the asylum after murdering his sister in the 1960s. at the same time moustapha akkad and his son malek were working on a story revolving around dr. wynn from halloween: the curse of michael myers. development on a direct sequel suddenly halted when moustapha akkad was killed in the 2005 amman hotel bombings while attending a wedding in jordan, and his son malek decided to take the series in a different direction.on june 4, 2006, dimension announced that rob zombie, director of house of 1000 corpses and the devil's rejects, would be creating the next installment in the halloween film series. the plan was for zombie to hold many positions in the production; he would write, direct, produce, and serve as music supervisor. bob weinstein approached him about making the film. zombie, who was a fan of the original halloween, jumped at the chance to make a halloween film for dimension studios. before dimension went public with the news, zombie felt obligated to inform carpenter, out of respect, of the plans to remake his film. carpenter's request was for zombie to "make it his own". during a june 16, 2006 interview, zombie announced that his film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept, and insisted that there would be considerable original content in the new film as opposed to mere rehashed material. the bbc reported that the new film would disregard the numerous sequels that followed halloween.

zombie's intention was to reinvent michael myers because he felt the character, along with freddy krueger, jason voorhees, and pinhead, had become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary. the idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into michael's backstory and add "new life" to the character. michael's mask would be given its own story to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store as in the original film. zombie explained that he wanted michael to be true to what a psychopath really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for michael to hide. he also wanted the young michael to have charisma, which would be projected onto the adult michael. in addition, he decided that michael's motives for returning to haddonfield would be more ambiguous, explaining, "[w]as he trying to kill laurie, or just find her because he loves her?" michael speaks as a child during the beginning of the film, but while in smith's grove he stops talking completely. zombie originally planned to have the adult michael speak to laurie in the film's finale, simply saying his childhood nickname for her, "boo". zombie explained that this version was not used because he was afraid having the character talk at that point would demystify him too much, and because the act of michael handing laurie the photograph of them together was enough.moreover, michael would not be able to drive in the new film, unlike his 1978 counterpart who stole loomis' car so that he could drive back to haddonfield. the dr. loomis character was also to be more intertwined with that of michael; zombie reasoned that the character's role in the original was "showing up merely to say something dramatic". although zombie added more history to the michael myers character, hence creating more original content for the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and carpenter's theme song intact for his version (despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched). production officially began on january 29, 2007. shortly before production began, zombie reported that he had seen the first production of michael's signature mask and commented, "it looks perfect, exactly like the original. not since 1978 has the shape looked so good". filming occurred in the same neighborhood that carpenter used for the original halloween.on december 19, 2006, zombie announced to bloody-disgusting that daeg faerch would play the part of ten-year-old michael myers. on december 22, 2006, malcolm mcdowell was officially announced to be playing dr. loomis. mcdowell stated that he wanted a tremendous ego in loomis, who is out to get a new book from the ordeal. on december 24, 2006, zombie announced that tyler mane, who had previously worked with zombie on the devil's rejects, would portray the adult michael myers. mane stated that it was very difficult to act only with his eyes. after winning the role, he noted that he consecutively watched seven of the eight halloween films (excluding the third because michael myers does not appear) to better understand his character. scout taylor-compton endured a long audition process, but as director zombie explains, "scout was my first choice. there was just something about her; she had a genuine quality. she didn't seem actor-y." she was one of the final people to be cast for a lead role after faerch, mane, mcdowell, forsythe, and harris. heather bowen, a fan who won a contest for a walk-on cameo appearance in 2005 when it was still intended to be a sequel, played a news reporter who covered michael's arrest, but her scene was cut from the film and does not appear in the deleted scenes. in the film's original ending, loomis is successful in convincing michael to let go of laurie as he is surrounded by police officers, telling michael he "did the right thing". despite loomis' protests, however, michael is killed shortly afterwards in a hail of gunfire, and the film ends with loomis looking down sadly at his former patient's corpse.


== release ==
approximately four days before the theatrical release of the film, a workprint version of halloween appeared online and was circulated around various bittorrent sites. upon hearing of the leaked copy, zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters. the leak of zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director eli roth attributed the financial failure of his film, hostel: part ii, to the leaking of a workprint version. dark horizons webmaster garth franklin noted that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in june 2007. for example, one particular scenethe rape of one of the smith's grove female inmateswas replaced in the final version. halloween was officially released on august 31, 2007, to 3,472 theaters in north america, giving it the widest release of any of the previous halloween films.

=== critical response ===
based on 117 reviews collected by rotten tomatoes, halloween received a 26% approval rating, with the consensus "rob zombie doesn't bring many new ideas to the table in halloween, making it another bloody disappointment for fans of the franchise." by comparison, metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a 47 out of 100 from the 18 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews". cinemascore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was "b-" on an a+ to f scale; it also reported that 62% of the audience was male, with 57% being 25 years or older.

peter hartlaub, of the san francisco chronicle, felt zombie was successful in both "[putting] his own spin on halloween, while at the same time paying tribute to carpenter's film"; he thought zombie managed to make michael myers almost "sympathetic" as a child, but that the last third of the film felt more like a montage of scenes with halloween slipping into "slasher-film logic". nathan lee of the village voice disagreed in part with harlaub, feeling that halloween may have placed too much emphasis on providing sympathy for michael myers, but that it succeeded in "[deepening] carpenter's vision without rooting out its fear". the film critic matthew turner believed the first half of the film, which featured the prequel elements of michael as a child, were better played than the remake elements of the second half. in short, turner stated that performances from the cast were "superb", with malcolm mcdowell being perfectly cast as dr. loomis, but that the film lacked the scare value of carpenter's original. jamie russell from bbc news agreed that the first half of the film worked better than the last half; she stated that zombie's expanded backstory on michael was "surprisingly effective"also agreeing that mcdowell was perfectly cast as loomisbut that zombie failed to deliver the "supernatural dread" that carpenter created for michael in his 1978 original.new york daily news critic jack matthews believed the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocksfocusing more on enhancing the "imagery of violence"than real attempts to scare the audience; he gave the film one and a half stars out of five. dennis harvey, from variety magazine, echoed matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt that you could not tell one teenage character from the next, whereas in carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities. writing 11 years after the film's release for the washington post, sonny bunch speculated that "the blowback theory of michael myers may have been comforting for a post-9/11 america mired in the iraq war trying to get a sense of how evil comes to be, but its deeply dissatisfying as the peg on which to hang a slasher movie villain." in contrast, rossiter drake of the examiner applauded michael's backstory, feeling that it was a "compelling take on the mythology" that managed to be "unique" and "shocking" at the same time. in agreement with other critics, empire magazine's kim newman felt that, because zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by michael, the film "[fell] flat" when it came to delivering suspense or anything "remotely scary"; newman did praise mcdowell for his portrayal of the "dogged psychiatrist". ben walter, of time out london, felt zombie added "surprising realism" to the development of michael myers psychopathic actions, but agreed with newman that the director replaced the original film's "suspense and playfulness" with a convincing display of "black-blooded brutality".frank scheck, of the hollywood reporter, believed that even though zombie's remake of carpenter's halloween was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. for scheck, zombie replaced carpenter's building suspense, which made it so "brilliant", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized mcdowell for lacking the intensity that donald pleasence brought to the loomis character. by contrast, tv guide's ken fox felt that zombie did deliver a "scary horror movie", not by copying carpenter, but by making the film his own. fox noted that zombie seemed to follow more in the footsteps of wes craven and tobe hooper's "savage, greasy-haired '70s" films, which allowed him to bring michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent "torture porn" horror films. bill gibron of popmatters believes that audiences and critics cannot compare carpenter's film to zombie's remake; where carpenter focused more on the citizens of haddonfieldwith michael acting as a true "boogeyman"zombie focuses more on michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that michael went through that would result in his "desire for death".quentin tarantino claims to have disliked the film when first viewing it in the theater, but grew to appreciate it for harris and faerch's performances and zombie's "sam peckinpah aesthetic."halloween won the rondo hatton classic horror award for best film of 2007, drawing in 550 votes, the most ever in the history of the award. the film also won the 'best remake award' at the 2008 spike tv scream awards. dan mathews, vice president of peta, sent rob zombie a thank-you letter for what he perceived as zombie sending a message to audiences when he depicted the young michael myers torturing animals, something he felt demonstrated that people who commit acts of cruelty to animals are likely to move on to humans. mathews went on to say, "hopefully, with the attention focused by your movie on the link between cruelty to animals and human violence, more people will recognize the warning signs among people they know and deal with them more forcefully. we wish you continued success!"carpenter himself was ambivalent about the film; during an audience q&a in 2016, carpenter stated that he took issue with zombie's comments that he was "cold" when they discussed the project and noted that it will color his perception of the film, and lamented that giving myers a backstory took away from the mystique. he later clarified that he is on good terms with zombie. carpenter, serving as an executive producer and creative consultant for the 2018 sequel to halloween (1978), expressed his disagreement with zombie's portrayal of myers, "i thought that he took away the mystique of the story by explaining too much about [michael myers]. i don't care about that. he's supposed to be a force of nature. he's supposed to be almost supernatural."


=== awards and nominations ===
the film was nominated for multiple awards for best film and acting. halloween was nominated by the sitges film festival for "best film", as did the rondo hatton classic horror awards, for which it won. sheri moon zombie was also nominated for best supporting actress at the fright meter awards.
