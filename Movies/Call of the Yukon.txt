adventuring author jean williams is living in the wilds of alaska alongside the eskimo people gathering material for her novel.  she befriends several animals who become her loyal friends such as a pair of bear cubs whose mother has been killed by hunter gaston rogers, a talking raven and the bereaved collie firefly who will not leave the grave of her master, a game warden killed in the line of duty.
the community is imperiled by a pack of wolves and wild dogs, led by a wild dog called swift lightning, who are killing all the reindeer.  with the supply of fresh meat gone, the eskimos are migrating to lands with more food.  hunter gaston agrees to take jean to nenana, alaska, along with his furs by dog sled.  jean, who despises gaston as being more savage and blood thirsty than the four-legged predators, is followed by her loyal animals.
