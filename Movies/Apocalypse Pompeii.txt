== production ==
this film marks the directing debut for ben demaree. previously he had been a cinematographer on numerous films, including the sharknado franchise. shooting took place for 12 days in sofia, bulgaria during the month of sept., and then a few splinter unit days at the real pompeii in italy.
most of the crew were local hires, with only a handful of people flown in from the us, including the sound mixer and steadicam operator. the cast was a mix of us, uk, and local bulgarians. there were financial advantages to filming in bulgaria, allowing the film to do bigger stunts including full body burns, setting cars on fire, and using cork bombs for explosions from 'flying volcanic rock'.


== reception ==
reviewer frank veenstra gave the film 4 out of 10 stars saying "the writing isn't all that great and to be honest, it's a very ridiculous movie but at the same time, it's also a pretty creative one."martin hafer of influx gave the film one out of five stars, citing that "the plot is stupid and the characters are shallowoften coming off as caricatures."
