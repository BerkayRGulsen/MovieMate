== critical reception ==
leonard maltin dismissed the film as "slight, forgettable fare"; allmovie called it "disposable"; whereas tv guide noted a "well-made, charming british picture with the standard seriocomic blend of 1950s english films", and sky movies praised diane cilento, "charm itself as the angel," and appreciated a "whimsical ealing-style comedy which keeps its feet firmly on the ground, spreading chuckles instead of sentiment and providing polished frolics in the process. felix aylmer - brilliant as the hard-bitten pawnbroker - jerry desmonde, alfie bass and a first-rate supporting cast help to put a high gloss on these heavenly capers".
