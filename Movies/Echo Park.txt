== history ==


=== edendale ===

first established in 1892, and long before hollywood became synonymous with the commercial film industry, the area of echo park known as edendale was the center of filmmaking on the west coast.by the 1910s, several film studios were operating on allesandro avenue (now glendale boulevard) along the echo park-silverlake border, including the selig polyscope company, mack sennett's keystone studios, the pathe west coast film studio, and others.several silent film stars worked in the edendale studios, including mabel normand, fatty arbuckle, and harold lloyd, and gloria swanson. charlie chaplin's first film was made at keystone studios, as well as the very first feature-length comedy ever made, which starred charlie chaplin and mabel normand.the first pie-in-the-face scene was filmed at what later became the mack sennett studios on glendale boulevard near effie street. the complex, which is now part of a storage facility, dates from 1909 and includes one of the area's first permanent sound stages, the factories where movies are made. the former studio, 1712 glendale boulevard, is city of los angeles historic-cultural monument no. 256.


=== echo park lake ===
echo park lake's earliest use by the city was as a reservoir. the los angeles canal and reservoir co. formed reservoir no. 4 in 1868. the company obtained the water by digging a ditch that sent water flowing from the los angeles river  in the area now known as los feliz  along a zigzag path that emptied into the reservoir.in 1891 the four owners of the surrounding area gave up 33 acres (13 ha) of land to the city around the reservoir so that it could be used as a park. the city began work landscaping the park in october 1892. city parks superintendent joseph henry tomlinson is recognized for coining the name of the new park, which later became the name of the neighborhood. he chose the name because of echoes he heard during the construction of echo park lake in 1892. by 1895, the park and accompanying boathouse were completed.by the late 1910s, motion picture companies on allesandro street, now glendale boulevard, had been using the park as a filming location. city leaders responded by barring keystone studios, home of the keystone kops, from shooting any of its comedies at the lake, on the grounds that too many flowers were being trampled.echo park lake was identified as an impaired body of water in 2006, and the city allocated $64.7 million to fund its cleanup and revitalization. the lake was closed off and drained in the summer of 2011 when renovation work began. the rehabilitation project tackled echo park lake not only as a recreational body of water, but also as an important part of the los angeles ecosystem. although echo park lake is man-made, it is part of the local watershed. the lake reopened on june 5, 2013 after a $45 million renovation.
since november 2019 there has been a significant population of homeless people living in tents in the park. on march 25, 2021, the park was closed for renovations and cleared the homeless encampments. this was done to address the high increase of the homeless population throughout the park and repair any damages. closure notices have were posted throughout the park days before the sweep, but a crowd of over 200 protesters met lapd. many believe it is inhumane to remove people from the park due to not enough housing resources within los angeles. according to mitch ofarrell, more than 120 people experiencing homeless at echo park lake have been successfully moved into transitional housing. this situation has caused tension between neighbors on how to handle the homeless problem in los angeles properly.


=== transportation ===


==== glendale freeway termination ====

the glendale freeway (sr 2) was originally planned and constructed in 1959 to connect with the hollywood freeway (us-101) through the neighborhoods of silver lake and echo park, but terminates roughly 1.5 miles (2.4 km) northeast of its intended terminus at the hollywood freeway due to opposition from residents living and developers building on a hill that is now a private gated community called hathaway estates. in 1962, as a result of this local community opposition, the full build-out plan was rescinded and construction was terminated at the present sr-2 terminus near glendale bl and duane street. since then, commuter traffic exiting and entering on to sr-2 has passed through the community, primarily along glendale bl and alvarado street, which has contributed to congestion. since that plan has been scrapped, the freeway is somewhat isolated from the remainder of the los angeles freeway system. there have been proposals to turn the freeway stub into a sort of public park.


==== pacific electric railway ====

the pacific electric railway, better known as the red cars, used to run through echo park along the center of glendale boulevard. the citywide system of electric trolleys began with the dawn of the 20th century, ultimately spinning a web of rail that linked cities in los angeles, orange, san bernardino and riverside counties. it was the largest and most advanced public transit system in the world at the time.
the red car system was sold to metropolitan coach lines, whose executive, jesse haugh, had connections to a public transportation company funded by general motors and other auto-related industries. the red cars faded out of service not long afterwards, with the los angeles-glendale-burbank line that traveled through echo park officially ending service on june 19, 1955.


=== gangs ===
echo park has been infamous as being a hot spot for gang activity. this was true in the 1980s and 1990s, but in the early 2010s as the neighborhood began gentrifying, rents started to skyrocket, and a controversial gang injunction forced gang members to move outside their turf, instances of gang violence waned.in 2013, a los angeles judge signed off on a permanent gang injunction aimed at six rival gangs in the echo park area, creating what authorities call a "safety zone" for the area. the injunction targets the members of six gangs, namely echo park locos, the crazys, the big top locos, the diamond street locos, frogtown rifa, and head hunters. the perimeter for the safety zone is roughly bound by the los angeles river to the north, the 110 freeway to the east, beverly boulevard to south and glendale boulevard to the west. it includes echo park lake park and dodger stadium.the injunction, a civil order, prohibits two or more listed gang members from associating in any way in public or in common areas like courtyards. it also allows for stricter penalties if any listed gang member is caught with drugs, alcohol, guns or vandalizing property.

since the 1910s, elysian heights, along with edendale, has been home to many of the counter-culture, political radicals, artists, writers, architects and filmmakers. the children of many progressives attended school there during the 1930s, '40s and '50s.


==== temple-beaudry or central city west ====
temple-beaudry forms a triangle south of the hollywood freeway, east of glendale boulevard, and west of beaudry. settled in the late 1800s as a residential neighborhood, many of the residences were torn down as part of slum clearance in preparation for a high school, which was instead turned into vista hermosa park, and in anticipations of the expansion of the downtown business district west across the harbor freeway, for which some promoters used the term "central city west" around 1990 for this area plus the area to its south, immediately west of the harbor freeway and as far south as olympic boulevard.


==== victor heights ====
victor heights lies between chinatown, los angeles, and the central part of echo park, off sunset boulevard near the pasadena freeway below elysian park. one of its streets is the hilly figueroa terrace, where in 1992 a resident named betty oyama lived and helped popularized a name for victor heights as the "forgotten edge", because, as she said, the police department couldn't figure out where victor heights was exactly. in a feature story about oyama's successful fight to form a neighborhood watch, a los angeles times reporter said of victor heights that it was "a mix of new and old housing styles and [of] residents who span the socioeconomic and ethnic spectrums. new condominium complexes stand next to 1920s-era bungalow houses and old apartment buildings."in 2009 victor heights and its hilly streets were described as "a collection of stuccoed apartments and faded bungalows, a place with a lot of old-timers." with its dramatic views of the los angeles civic center, victor heights had a population of "older italians and croatians who once dominated the area," along with "newer asian and latino immigrants [and] a smattering of hipsters betting that victor heights will be the next big thing." the area became known for the flock of peacocks and peahens, with their chicks, who had taken over parts of the district, often on everett street, where they gathered in the morning.victor heights is an old area. in 1887 "choice lots, commanding a splendid view," were being advertised for $1,200. lesser lots went for $700 to $1,300. all had "water piped through the street." in 1908 its residents took a fight against disruptive dynamite blasting by the los angeles brick company in chavez ravine to the los angeles city police commission. they complained that the explosions were "cracking the plaster on their walls and causing their homes to settle to such an extent that they could not open their doors.
