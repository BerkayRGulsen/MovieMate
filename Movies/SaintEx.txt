== production ==
saint-ex was filmed and distributed in the united kingdom. the film was director anand tucker's feature film debut,and combines elements of biography, documentary and dramatic re-creation. the use of period documentary interviews in black-and-white is interspersed with live action and optical effects generated on film in colour.


== reception ==
saint-ex was reviewed by derek elley for variety: "reach falls short of ambition in 'saint-ex,' an intriguing attempt to create a cinematic tone-poem to legendary french flyer-cum-novelist antoine de saint-exupery that only rarely gets both wheels off the ground. despite some striking visuals and an evident desire to take a fresh look at the biopic genre, the movie remains strangely uninvolving for much of the time and isn't helped by a miscast bruno ganz as the titular aviator. theatrical prospects look fog-bound."
