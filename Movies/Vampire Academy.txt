== plot ==
rose hathaway, a seventeen-year-old dhampir (half-human, half-vampire) guardian-in-training, and her best friend, moroi (the peaceful, mortal vampires having royal bloodlines) princess vasilisa (lissa) dragomir, are living discreetly, having escaped from the st. vladimir's academy boarding school one year prior. they are soon dragged back to the academy in montana and rediscover the dangerous hierarchy within it, along with lies, rumors and secrets, both struggling to fit into the school politics. rose starts to form an attraction to her russian dhampir mentor and fellow guardian, dimitri belikov.
mysterious messages threatening lissa start to appear, written on the wall in blood and an exploding memorial to her family in the school church. they suspect that it is the work of classmate mia rinaldi, who once dated lissa's now-deceased brother andre, a playboy who enjoyed non-committal relationships. mia was clingy and focused her hatred towards lissa as the only surviving member of the dragomir line. manipulating two other students using sex, she persuaded them to help her spread rumors about rose. a moroi named christian ozera, who is viewed poorly by his peers because his parents became strigoi (the evil, undead vampires of legend, which moroi become if they completely drain their victims of blood, or are turned), tries to romance lissa but rose manages to keep him away by lying to both lissa and christian. christian is good for lissa, but rose doesn't like him and tries to sabotage their relationship.
rose also discovers that lissa has the same rare power that the founder of their school st. vladimir had, that of spirit, a power which enables the caster to heal ailments, and saves the dying; however, using spirit drains the user's life energy bit by bit with each use. at the same time, dead animals have been popping up wherever lissa goes. at the equinox dance, rose confronts mia, believing she is responsible for all the dead animals. mia, however, is horrified because she loves cats. soon, lissa is kidnapped and rose, dimitri, and christian rush to save her.
the moroi responsible for lissa's kidnapping and the threats against her is victor dashkov, a previous candidate for the throne, who has contracted a disease that leaves him too feeble for the job. he wants to use lissa to cure himself, even knowing that the cure would cost lissa's life as continued healing would eventually take its toll on her. once captured and placed in the secure cells beneath the school, victor explains to rose that the reason she bonded to lissa is that she was "shadow-kissed", having been brought back to life by lissa's magic. while they are talking, victor's daughter natalie, who befriended both lissa and rose and was a very insecure student at the school, is enacting the tools of his escape having turned strigoi by draining her crush to death. dimitri comes and kills natalie and detains victor.
during a speech by vampire queen tatiana ivashkov, lissa steps in and gives a speech of her own, announcing that spirit is her type of magic, and that it is thanks to rose that she can master it. rose then goes outside to meet dimitri and ask about his feelings for her. he states that he can't love her because if there was any danger between rose and lissa, he would save her instead of lissa. rose gives dimitri a kiss on the cheek and walks back to the academy. a mountain cave not too far from the academy holds a massive army of strigoi, among them being sonya karp, a teacher with spirit magic that turned herself strigoi after being driven insane by her magic.
