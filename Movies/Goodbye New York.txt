== critical reception ==
janet maslin of the new york times said the film possesses "an easygoing charm that, among israeli films, is rare", presenting "witty impressions of israeli life" and the clash of cultures. candace russell of the south florida sun-sentinel likened kollek's "absurdist worldview and droll understatement" to that of woody allen. while people thought the film "likable" and "genial", the reviewers noted its "uneven" script and direction, and a "sometimes contrived or just plain silly" plot. london's time out was more unequivocal, dismissing the "thin and clichd material", its "predictable plot and dismal propaganda about the values of kibbutz culture."
