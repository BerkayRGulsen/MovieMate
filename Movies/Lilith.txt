== production ==
chestnut lodge would not permit filming on location so those scenes were done in a vacant mansion rented by the production company, centur productions, on the north shore of long island (locust valley). location shooting in maryland was done in a private home in rockville as well as in the downtown area, plus scenes at great falls on both the maryland and virginia sides of the potomac river, as well as a staged carnival scene at barnesville, maryland. this was rossen's last film.
