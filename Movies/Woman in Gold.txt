== plot ==

in a series of flashbacks, maria altmann recalls the anschluss, the arrival of nazi forces in vienna, the persecution of the jewish community and the looting and pillaging by the nazis against jewish families. maria altmann and members of her family attempt to flee to the united states. while altmann and her husband are successful, she is forced to abandon her parents in vienna.
in the present, living in los angeles, an elderly and widowed altmann attends the funeral for her sister. she discovers letters in her sister's possession dating to the late 1940s, which reveal an attempt to recover artwork owned by the bloch-bauer family that was left behind during the family's flight for freedom and stolen by the nazis. of particular note is a painting of altmann's aunt, adele bloch-bauer, now known in austria as the "woman in gold".
altmann enlists the help of e. randol schoenberg (the son of her close friend, barbara), a lawyer with little experience, to make a claim to the art restitution board in austria. reluctantly returning to her homeland, altmann discovers that the country's minister and art director are unwilling to part with the painting, which they feel has become part of the national identity. altmann is told that the painting was legitimately bequeathed to the gallery by her aunt. upon further investigation by her lawyer and austrian journalist hubertus czernin, this claim proves to be wrong as the alleged will is invalid due to the fact that her aunt did not own the painting, the artist's fee having been paid by altmann's uncle. adele bloch-bauer wanted the painting to go to the museum at her husband's death but it was taken from him by the nazis and placed in the museum by a nazi-collaborating curator, well before his death. schoenberg files a challenge with the art restitution board but it is denied and altmann does not have the money needed to challenge the ruling. defeated, she and schoenberg return to the united states.
months later, happening upon an art book with "woman in gold" on the cover, schoenberg has an epiphany. using a narrow rule of law and precedents in which an art restitution law was retrospectively applied, schoenberg files a claim in us court against the austrian government contesting their claim to the painting. an appeal goes to the supreme court of the united states, where in the matter of republic of austria v. altmann, the court rules in altmann's favor, which results in the austrian government attempting to persuade altmann to retain the painting for the gallery, which she refuses. after a falling out over the issue of returning to austria for a second time to argue the case, altmann agrees for schoenberg to go and argue the case in front of a panel of three arbiters in vienna.
in austria, the panel hears the case, during which schoenberg reminds them of the nazi regime's crimes. he implores the arbitration panel to think of the meaning of the word "restitution" and to look past the artwork hanging in art galleries to see the injustice to the families who once owned such great paintings and were forcibly separated from them by the nazis. unexpectedly, altmann arrives during the session, indicating to czernin that she came to support her lawyer. after considering both sides of the dispute, the arbitration panel rules in favour of altmann, returning her paintings. the austrian government representative makes a last-minute proposal begging altmann to keep the paintings in the belvedere against a generous compensation. altmann refuses and elects to have the painting moved to the united states with her ("they will now travel to america like i once had to as well") and takes up an offer made earlier by ronald lauder to acquire them for his new york gallery to display the painting on condition that it be a permanent exhibit.

== historical accuracy ==
altmann's efforts actually addressed five klimt paintings owned by her family, including portrait of adele bloch-bauer i and portrait of adele bloch-bauer ii, as well as three landscapes. the decisions by the us supreme court and the austrian arbitrators covered all five paintings.
film critics in austria and germany noted various deviations of the film from historical reality. olga kronsteiner from the austrian daily der standard wrote that it was not maria altmann's lawyer, randol schnberg, who researched and initiated the restitution case, but austrian journalist hubertus czernin, who had worked on a number of restitution files at the time, who found the decisive documents and subsequently informed maria altmann.hubertus czernin, who is depicted in the movie, is suggested to have been motivated by the fact that his father had been a member of the nazi party; but stefan grissemann from austrian weekly profil pointed out that his father's party membership was not known to czernin until 2006, long after he had started to work on this and other restitution cases; and that in addition czernin's father was imprisoned by the nazis late in the war for high treason.thomas trenkler from the viennese daily kurier criticized the film's reference to a time limit for restitution claims in austria, writing that there has never been such a time limit. he also wrote that his least favorite scene in the film was when maria altmann leaves her ailing father in vienna in 1938. despite the imminent danger, maria altmann stayed in vienna, having said, "i would never have left my father! he died of natural causes in july 1938". only then did she and her husband escape from vienna.in june 2006, based on an earlier agreement between altmann and ronald lauder (which was shown in the film), altmann sold portrait of adele bloch-bauer i to lauder's neue galerie new york for $135 million ($171 million today), setting a new mark for most expensive painting (since surpassed). five months later, altmann sold the companion portrait of adele bloch-bauer ii at auction (bought by oprah winfrey) for almost $88 million ($112 million today), then the third-highest priced painting.gustav bloch-bauer had been loaned the famous "gore booth baron rothschild" stradivarius cello (see list of stradivarius instruments) by the rothschild family, which was looted by the nazis in 1938 and retained by the german authorities till 1956.
