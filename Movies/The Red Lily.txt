== censorship concerns ==
the film industry created the national association of the motion picture industry in 1916 in an effort to preempt censorship by states and municipalities, and it used a list of subjects called the "thirteen points" which film plots were to avoid. however, prostitution was not explicitly barred so long as it was not forced (i.e., white slavery) and aspects of her work was not present in the film.
