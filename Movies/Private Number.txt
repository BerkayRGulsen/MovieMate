private number is a 1936 american drama film directed by roy del ruth and starring loretta young, robert taylor and basil rathbone. it is sometimes known by the alternative title of secret interlude. it was based on the play common clay by cleves kinkead which had previously been made into a film of the same name in 1930. following the more rigorous enforcement of the motion picture production code after 1934, many of the more salacious elements of the earlier film were left out.
