bloodlust is a 1992 australian vampire film directed by jon hewitt and richard wolstencroft and starring big bad ralph and kelly chapman.


== premise ==
in the streets of melbourne, three vampires wander around killing, having sex and taking drugs. they carry out a heist, which involves stealing $3 million which attracts the attention of many psychotics, who chase them through a blood spattered odyssey into the melbourne underground.


== production ==
co-director jon hewitt described it as:

a purpose-made, market-driven, crass, exploitation film. it isn't particularly good but, for me, it was really my film school. it's where i taught myself how to make a feature film and made a lot of mistakes on it - but i tried to learn from them. it was a film made in the context of not really being able to get any support for anything i was trying to do, then just going out and making something that i thought would have a back-end market, would be a safe bet, a sort of straight-to-video schlock film.
filming took six weeks and was very difficult, with one member of the cast being arrested on drug charges. however hewitt says it proved profitable.
