== plot ==
blade searches prague for his mentor abraham whistler, who was thought dead after being attacked by deacon frost, but was instead turned into a vampire and held prisoner for two years. blade rescues whistler and cures him. whistler meets scud, blade's new technician. 
a pandemic is turning vampires into "reapers", primal, mutant creatures with a ravenous thirst for blood and a highly infectious bite that transforms both human and vampire alike. in order to combat the reapers, vampire overlord eli damaskinos sends his minion, asad, and daughter nyssa to strike a truce with blade; who reluctantly allies with the vampires. he teams up with the bloodpack, an elite group of vampires originally assembled to kill him. the pack consists of asad, nyssa, reinhardt, chupa, snowman, verlaine, her lover lighthammer and priest. reinhardt hates blade, and challenges him to fight, but in response blade implants an explosive on his head to keep him in line.
they investigate a vampire nightclub where they encounter the reapers and discover they are immune to most vampire weaknesses. the reaper, nomak, arrives and holds nyssa hostage. he tries to recruit blade to his cause, citing their mutual hatred of vampires. priest is bitten and mercy-killed, and lighthammer is bitten but conceals the bite. whistler disappears and scud is attacked by several reapers, which he drives off with uv lights. blade fights nomak, who is immune to blade's weapons. as the sun rises, nomak retreats and whistler returns, revealing he has found the reaper nest in the sewer. nyssa dissects a dead reaper and learns their hearts are encased in durable bone. realizing uv light is their only weakness, scud and whistler make uv weapons for the team, as well as a uv-emitting bomb strong enough to take out the entire nest.
entering the reaper nest, the team spreads out. lighthammer transforms into a reaper and kills snowman. verlaine sacrifices herself to kill lighthammer by exposing them both to sunlight. chupa and reinhart attack whistler, who sprays chupa with a reaper pheromone. this attracts a horde which kills chupa and whistler escapes. asad and nyssa are ambushed and asad is killed. blade saves nyssa and uses the uv-bomb which kills all of the reapers except for nomak. nyssa and reinhardt manage to evade the blast, but nyssa is seriously injured until blade allows her to drink his blood to survive.
damaskinos' forces betray and capture blade, whistler, and scud. it is revealed that the reapers exist as a result of damaskinos' efforts to engineer a stronger breed of vampires. nomak, the first reaper, is his own son, whom damaskinos considers a failure due to his weakness to sunlight. scud reveals himself to be one of damaskinos' familiars, but blade, who already suspected this, kills him with the explosive he planted on reinhardt earlier. damaskinos plans to harvest blades blood in order to develop an immunity to sunlight and create a new and entirely invincible breed of vampires. whistler escapes reinhardt and frees a nearly drained blade, who falls into damiskinos' blood pool, restoring his strength. he fights his way through damaskinos' henchmen and kills reinhardt.
nomak enters damaskinos' stronghold seeking revenge on his father. nyssa betrays damaskinos by sealing off their escape route to the heliport and damaskinos is killed by nomak after failing to negotiate with him. nomak then bites and infects nyssa. blade and nomak engage in battle and blade stabs nomak in his only weak spot. with his revenge complete, and wanting to end his suffering, nomak kills himself with blade's sword. fulfilling nyssa's wish of dying as a vampire, blade takes her outside and embraces her as she dies while watching the sunrise.

== production ==
following the success of the original film, new line and marvel made plans for a sequel in 1999. it is said that the film was going to introduce hannibal king and frank drake in the series as well as a time travel storyline where blade goes years in the future. guillermo del toro was hired to direct blade ii by new line production president michael de luca after stephen norrington turned down the offer to direct the sequel. goyer and frankfurt both admired director guillermo del toro and believed his dark sensibilities to be ideal for blade ii. frankfurt first met del toro when frankfurt's design company, imaginary forces, did the title sequences for mimic. "i admired mimic and got to know guillermo through that film", says frankfurt. "both david goyer and i have been fans of his since cronos and were enthusiastic about him coming on board. guillermo is such a visual director and has a very strong sense of how he wants a movie to look. when you sign on with someone like guillermo you're not going to tell him what the movie should look like, you're going to let him run with it". like goyer, del toro has a passion for comic books. "guillermo was weaned on comic books, as was i", says goyer. "i was a huge comic book collector, my brother and i had about twelve thousand comic books that we assembled when we were kids, so i know my background". tippett studio provided computer-generated visual effects, including digital doubles of some of the characters, while steve johnson and his company xfx were hired to create the prosthetic makeup and animatronic effects.del toro chose not to alter the script too much from the ideas created by goyer and snipes. "i wanted the movie to have a feeling of both a comic book and japanese animation", said the director. "i resurrected those sources and viewed them again. i dissected most of the dailies from the first movie; i literally grabbed about four boxes of tapes and one by one saw every single tape from beginning to end until i perfectly understood where the language of the first film came from. i studied the style of the first one and i think norrington used a tremendous narrative style. his work is very elegant".
stepping back into blade's shoes was a challenge wesley snipes relished. "i love playing this role. it's fun as an actor to test your skills at doing a sequel, to see if you can recreate something that you did", snipes says. peter frankfurt adds, "wesley is blade; so much of the character was invented by wesley and his instincts are so spot on. he takes his fighting, his weapons and attitude very seriously. he's incredibly focused, but he's also very cool and fun".
"wesley knows blade better than david goyer, better than me, better than anyone else involved in the franchise", adds del toro. "he instinctively knows what the character would and wouldn't do, and every time he twists something around, something better would come out".
filming took place in the czech republic, at prague studios and barrandov studios, as well as london from march 12, 2001 and concluded july 2, 2001.
