== plot ==
young scientist victor frankenstein lives with his parents and his beloved bull terrier dog, sparky, in the quiet town of new holland. victor's intelligence is recognized by his classmates at school, including his somber next-door neighbor, elsa van helsing, the mischievous edgar "e" gore, the obese and gullible bob, the overconfident toshiaki, the creepy nassor, and an eccentric girl nicknamed "weird girl". despite their admiration of him, he communicates little with them due to his relationship with his dog. concerned with his son's isolation, victor's father encourages him to take up baseball and make achievements outside of science. victor hits a home run at his first game; sparky, seeing victor's hit, runs away from the bleachers to pursue the ball, to which he is struck and killed by a car, leaving victor saddened.
inspired by his new science teacher mr. rzykruski's demonstration of the effect of electricity on dead frogs, victor digs up sparky, brings him to his makeshift laboratory in the attic, and successfully reanimates him with a bolt of lightning. seeing weird girl's cat, mr. whiskers, the resurrected sparky escapes from the attic and explores the neighborhood. he is recognized by edgar, who blackmails victor into teaching him how to raise the dead. together, the two reanimate a dead goldfish which turns invisible due to an error with the experiment. edgar brags about the fish to his classmates, but when he tries to show it to a skeptical nassor, it is gone, leading him to speculate that they can only last for a short time. in fear of losing the upcoming science fair, toshiaki and bob make a rocket out of soda bottles, which causes bob to break his arm. mr. rzykruski is blamed for the accident and fired. the gym teacher replaces him; before mr. rzykruski leaves town, he advises victor to use science wisely.
when edgar is confronted by toshiaki, nassor and bob on the baseball field at school, he accidentally reveals victor's actions, inspiring them to try reanimation themselves. victor's parents discover sparky in the attic and are frightened, causing the dog to flee. while victor and his parents search for sparky, the classmates invade the lab, discovering victor's reanimation formula. the classmates separately perform their experiments, which go awry and turn the dead animals into monsters: mr. whiskers holds a dead bat while it is electrocuted, resulting in him becoming a monstrous vampiric feline, edgar turns a dead rat he found in the garbage into a wererat, nassor revives his mummified hamster, colossus, toshiaki's turtle, shelley, is covered in miracle gro and turns into a gamera-like monster, and bob's sea-monkeys grow into gremlin-like amphibious humanoids. the monsters break loose into the town fair, where they wreak havoc.
after finding sparky at the town's pet cemetery, victor sees the monsters heading to the fair and goes with his classmates to help deal with them; the sea-monkeys explode after eating salt-covered popcorn, and colossus is stepped on by shelley, while the rat and shelley are returned to their original, deceased forms after both are electrocuted. during the chaos, persephone, elsa's pet poodle, is grabbed by mr. whiskers and carried to the town windmill with elsa and victor giving pursuit. the townsfolk blame sparky for elsa's disappearance and chase him to the windmill, which elsa's uncle accidentally ignites with his torch. victor and sparky enter the burning windmill and rescue elsa and persephone, but victor is trapped inside. sparky rescues victor, only to be dragged back inside by mr. whiskers, who is fatally impaled by a flaming piece of wood during their confrontation before the windmill collapses on sparky, killing him again. to reward him for his bravery and saving victor, the townsfolk gather and revive sparky with their car batteries. persephone runs to sparky and they kiss.

== production ==


=== development ===
although tim burton signed with walt disney pictures to direct two films in disney digital 3-d, including alice in wonderland and his remake of frankenweenie, development for its full-length stop motion version dates as far back as november 2005, when scripts had been written by josann mcgibbon and sara parriott. john august was approached for a rewrite in 2006, but was not hired until january 2009. like the original, the feature version was shot in black and white. many of the animation artists and crew from corpse bride were involved. burton also borrowed heavily from his design from the titular character of family dog for sparky.


=== filming ===
filming began at 3 mills studios in july 2010. the crew created three giant sound stages, including victor's cluttered family attic, a cemetery exterior, and a high school interior. the sound stages were then divided into 30 separate areas to deal with the handcrafted, frame-by-frame style of filmmaking. compared to other stop-motion animation sets, frankenweenie's set is much larger. as ign notes, the main character sparky had to be "'dog-size' compared to the other human characters, but also large enough to house all the elements of the mechanical skeleton secreted within his various foam and silicon-based incarnation". on the other hand, the mechanics are small and delicate, and in some instances they had to have swiss watchmakers create the tiny nuts and bolts. around 200 separate puppets were used, with roughly 18 different versions of victor. the puppets also have human hair, with 4045 joints for the human characters and about 300 parts for sparky.


=== music and soundtrack ===

in early 2011, it was announced that danny elfman would score frankenweenie, with work already started on pre-production music.prior to the film's release, an "inspired by" soundtrack album, frankenweenie: unleashed!, as well as elfman's frankenweenie: the original motion picture soundtrack, was released by walt disney records on september 25, 2012. frankenweenie: unleashed! contains bonus content that includes a custom icon and an app that will load a menu to view more the bonus content, provide input, or buy more music from disney music group.
