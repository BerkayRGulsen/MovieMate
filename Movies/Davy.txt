=== critical ===
tv guide called the film a "pleasant if unimpressive drama" ; britmovie wrote, " stylistically the film is an awkward combination of broad farce, secombe having made his name as one of the denizens of the celebrated goon show, and awkward, turgid scenes of moral conflict" ; while  allmovie noted, "a stellar supporting cast enables davy to overcome its occasional banalities and cliches."
