== critical reception ==
the radio times wrote "this tale of blindness and rage should have been a real nail-biter. sadly, ex-documentary director david eady simply doesn't have the thriller instinct and throws away countless opportunities to make the tension unbearable." however, tv guide wrote that "the film has some pot-holes, but the chilling climax is smooth as glass"; and allmovie noted "although there may be a few minor gaps here and there in the storyline, faces in the dark is a suspenseful drama."
