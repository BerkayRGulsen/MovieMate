== controversy ==
ting-yin finds herself in a parallel universe where abandoned things end up, including aborted fetuses, which combined with the portrayal of the main character's personal demons regarding her own aborted child leads some critics to believe the film carries an anti-abortion message. "that just happens to be one of the topics in the movie. we are not out to say if abortion is right or wrong", oxide pang said in one interview.
