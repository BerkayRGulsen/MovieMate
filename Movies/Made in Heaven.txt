== critical reception ==
in 1952, picturegoer wrote, ". . .when you get down to analysing the ingredients, it's just cream-puff comedy, really  and the least bit stale cream puff at that. the main thing though is not to analyse but to swallow it whole and enjoy it. it's well-tried and not always especially true british comedy, but the film has a happy air about it. attractively grown-up pet clark turns in a sparkling performance as the doubting young wife. she manages to hold her own against the devastating eyelashes and flashing, wicked smiles of sonja ziemann as the hired help. but it's the old hands at this kind of comedy who really carry the fun along: david tomlinson, charles victor and a. e. matthews, as son, father and grandfather respectively, all stock characters. yes it's all gay and merry. it has a springtime spirit  and a springtime look, too in its spruce, sunny technicolour"; while more recently, the radio times concluded, "vicar richard wattis and his stern sister (athene seyler) add considerably to the fun, which is steadily directed in an amiably sitcom-like way by john paddy carstairs and glossily photographed by geoffrey unsworth."
