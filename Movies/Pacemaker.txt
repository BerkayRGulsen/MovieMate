== plot ==
joo man-ho, a boy from an impoverished family, has a talent for long-distance running but always finishes second place in a race  on purpose, in order to win the box of instant noodles given to runners-up. he grows up to become a national marathoner, but because of an injury, he never becomes a premier athlete and instead hold himself back as he did in his childhood. he is relegated to the role of "pacemaker"  someone who runs alongside the star athletes for three-quarters of the marathon (30 of 42.195 kilometers), making sure they stay on winning pace, but then letting them finish the race alone. later in life, a cold-hearted marathon coach scouts joo to run again, this time pacing for korea's star marathoner at the 2012 london olympics. this creates an opportunity for joo to complete his lifetime goal of actually running a full olympic marathon, but he must first summon the courage and drive to fulfill his dream and run for himself and no one else.
