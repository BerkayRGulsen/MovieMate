== reception ==
janet maslin of the new york times found director joan darling "peculiarly misogynistic" in the way the two female lead characters "both pounce avariciously upon mr. katt, who seems passive and rather saintly under pressure ... both miss hitchcock's script and miss darling's directing suggest that he is far too good for either lover."  gene siskel of the chicago tribune gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and called it "an in-and-out-of-love story with its characters' actions determined only by a writer's whimsy. you watch the picture and realize that the opposite of what is happening could be taking place and it would make just as much or little sense." arthur d. murphy of variety wrote that katt and dey were both "excellent" but "an unfortunate element in the story is the never-ending pall of doom that hangs over everything ... where it should have been bittersweet, it's bland-gloomy." charles champlin of the los angeles times stated that director joan darling "seems indeed to have a nice way with her performers, but some problems of script and casting defeat the film's obvious intentions and make what ought to have been a slight and tender work not only disappointing but actively unpleasant." k.c. summers of the washington post wrote that the film "is the basically ho-hum story of a romance between an inexperienced college boy and a girl who's been around some. everyone tries very hard, and there are a few feeble attempts at suspense, but the viewer never really gets involved enough to care how the affair ends up." david ansen of newsweek declared, "there is one good reason to see first love, and his name is william katt ... he manages to radiate sweetness without being cloying, ingenuousness without coyness and sexuality without narcissism." however, ansen added, director darling "hasn't quite mastered the transition from tv to screen; everything is staged up front, every emotion hit squarely on the head, and the result is a certain monotony of tone." tom milne of the monthly film bulletin wrote, "fulsomely cradled in slow motion and caressing dissolves, sprinkled with cultural references to dante and idealistic philosophies, indulging much lachrymose drivel about first love and its irreparable loss, this son of love story similarly tries to prove that the spirit of romance is not dead and proceeds to administer a cruel coup de grce."michael eisner of paramount said the film did not lose money "but was not a success".
