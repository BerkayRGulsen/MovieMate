== reception ==
matt ravier of in film australia gave the film a negative review, noting "[t]he wrong-side-of-the-tracks film is an indie staple stateside. this australian variant doesnt succeed in updating the well-worn genre and seems happy to simply recycle the classic coming-of-age elements of more successful productions." margaret pomeranz of abc's at the movies provided a more favourable reception concluding that it "may not be an easy film for audiences but for me it was a tremendously moving and rewarding experience."


== box office ==
west grossed $57,472 at the box office in australia.
