final destination is an american horror franchise composed of five films, two comic books, and nine novels. it is based on an unproduced spec script by jeffrey reddick, originally written for the x-files television series, and was distributed by new line cinema. all five films center around a small group of people who escape impending death when one individual (the protagonist of each film) has a sudden premonition and warns them that they will all die in a terrible mass-casualty accident. after avoiding their foretold deaths, the survivors are killed one by one in bizarre accidents caused by an unseen force creating complicated chains of cause and effect, resembling rube goldberg machines in their complexity, and then read omens sent by another unseen entity in order to again avert their deaths.
the series is noteworthy among other films in the horror genre in that the antagonist is not a stereotypical slasher or other physical being, but death manifested, subtly manipulating circumstances in the environment with a design on claiming anyone who escapes their fated demise.
in addition to the films, a novel series, which includes the novelizations of the first three films, was published throughout 2005 and 2006 by black flame. a one-shot comic book titled final destination: sacrifice was released alongside select dvds of final destination 3 in 2006, and a comic book series titled final destination: spring break was published by zenescope entertainment in 2007.


== background ==
final destination was written by jeffrey reddick after having "read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'don't take the flight tomorrow, i have a really bad feeling about it.'". the woman switched flights and the plane she was originally supposed to take crashed. originally having written the script as an episode of the x files, reddick decided to turn the script into a feature-length film at the behest of one of his new line cinema colleagues. after reading his spec script, new line cinema hired reddick to write the screenplay; james wong and glen morgan were later brought on board to help with the script, making alterations to comply with their standards.
it was based on the fateful flight twa 800, specifically, the 16 students and 5 adults of the montoursville hs.

=== final destination 6 (2022) ===
in 2011, tony todd said that if final destination 5 was a success at the box office, then two sequels would be filmed back-to-back. on august 23, when asked whether he would be directing a sequel, steven quale elaborated: "who knows. never say never. i mean, it'll be up to the fans. we'll see how this one performs internationally, and if it makes as much money as the fourth one, i'm sure warner brothers will want to make another one".in january 2019, a new installment was announced to be in development, from warner bros. pictures and new line cinema. patrick melton and marcus dunstan will write the script, with the plot described as a "re-imagining" of the franchise. in august, devon sawa expressed interest in returning to the franchise in the reboot.in march 2020, the film, set in the same canon as the first five films, would focus on first responders, with series producer craig perry stating: "we're toying with having it take place in the world of first responders: emts, firemen, and police. these people deal with death on the front lines every day and make choices that can cause people to live or die. we rely on their good judgment, expertise, and calm demeanor. so why not put those people in the nightmare situation where every choice can bring about life and death  but now for themselves? we're thinking that world might be an interesting way into a final destination movie, and one which can also generate unique set pieces in a very credible way".on october 5, 2020, series creator jeffrey reddick confirmed that a sixth film had been in the works prior to the covid-19 pandemic. final destination 6 is set to be released in 2022.

== themes ==

three critical theories about the final destination franchise have been discussed in scholarly works. it has been framed as a postmodern horror franchise that, like the scream franchise, self-consciously refers to the history of horror cinema and rewards viewers for their knowledge. second, the filmsparticularly the final destination (2009) and final destination 5 (2011)have been examined for their visual effects. third, the franchise has been criticized for being cynical and reductive. for example, film studies scholar reynold humphries dismisses the franchise as "obscurantist nonsense whose only 'idea' is that death is an agency that has a 'plan' for each of us".according to media studies scholar eugenie brinkema, final destination films are characterized by their move away from the typical horror antagonist and toward the certainty and inevitability of death. this makes them inconsistent with most other horror films, which require a monster. final destination films depart further from other horror films, even those aimed at teenagers, in that a family narrative is lacking, and there are no hauntings of any kind. as well, there is no sexuality"neither the pursuit of pleasure in the slasher convention of easy bodily access nor the monstrosity of sexual difference". brinkema argues the films are not about seeking pleasure like typical slasher films. instead they are about the avoidance of pain and death; they are fundamentally "bitter ... paranoid, and sad" and display the inability of characters to feel pleasure. in these films, death becomes its own cause. the premonition of the roller coaster derailment in final destination 3 is without context or cause. the avoidance of death by some characters grounds the necessity of their deaths, specifically the order in which they would have died on the roller coaster. thus, "death's list" or "death's design" is realized. final destination 3 spends as much time interpreting deaths as displaying them. wendy's close analysis of photographs allows her to understand the deaths, but is inevitably too late to save her friends. in the franchise's films, brinkema says, "one must closely read to survive (for a spell), and yet reading changes absolutely nothing at all". thus, the characters "might as well" have stayed on the roller coaster.ian conrich, a film studies scholar, argues the series marks a key departure from slasher norms in that death itself becomes the villain. final destination films draw influences from slasher cinema but the franchise's action sequences, including final destination 3's roller coaster derailment, draw from action and disaster cinema. for conrich, the franchise marks a new slasher film subgenre. because the deaths are extremely violent and excessive, any number can happen at once, and all of them are inevitable, he calls the films "grand slashers". other grand slashers include the films in the saw and cube franchises.a notable feature of the final destination films is the threshold or tipping-point logic of characters' deaths. conrich frames the complex death sequences in final destination films as "death games, contraptions or puzzles in which there are only losers". he compares the sequences to rube goldberg machines, the grand guignol, and the mouse trap board game. brinkema selects the deaths of ashley and ashlyn from final destination 3 as epitomizing the series' death sequences. the characters' deaths are brought about by "a series of neutral gestures, a set of constraints that will ultimately lead to their conflagratory ends"; these include the placing of a drink, looking through cds, and an ill-chosen doorstop. the scene uses logics of temperature, color, and light to realize the characters' deaths, and to allow wendy to recognize the threat they face. an example of the "literal tipping point" at which the characters can no longer escape occurs when a coat rack is knocked onto the tanning beds; it is blown by an air conditioning unit that is activated by the increasing heat. conrich identifies the roller coaster derailment as an example of the franchise's focus on mobility in death sequences. he argues that theme park rides and horror cinema are mutually influential; the former draw from the frightening aspects of the latter, while the latter draw from the "theatrics and kinetics" of the former.
