== plot ==
carly whitten (cameron diaz), a new york attorney, has started a relationship with mark king (nikolaj coster-waldau), a handsome and charismatic businessman, whom she has been having sex with for eight weeks. carly, planning to introduce mark to her father, frank (don johnson), is upset that mark has to go out of town on account of a "flood" at his connecticut home, missing their dinner. however, her father encourages her to go to his house anyway. so, carly dresses up in a sexy plumber's outfit and heads to mark's house to seduce him. however, she is horrified to be met at the door by mark's wife, kate (leslie mann), whom she had originally assumed to be mark's housekeeper. thrown for a loop by this revelation, carly accidentally breaks one of kate's garden urns, making up a weak excuse as to why she is there, and staggers home, embarrassed and in shock.  
the next day, kate shows up at carly's law firm, having found her contact details in mark's phone book. carly informs her that mark has been cheating on both of them but promises the panicked kate she had no idea mark was married. initially annoyed by kate's constant presence at her apartment or work, carly begins to warm to her after a wild sleepover and a boozy heart-to-heart. kate then discovers that mark is still seeing another woman, who she thinks is carly secretly continuing her previous relationship with mark. she confronts carly about this and the two argue before realizing that mark is seeing a third woman as both carly and kate have been refusing sex with him. 
carly and kate follow mark to the hamptons, where they stay at the house of kate's brother, phil (taylor kinney), who is immediately attracted to carly. the duo spies on mark and find him with his mistress amber, (kate upton), a beautiful 22-year-old, on the beach, and when mark leaves for the gym, the two women inform amber that mark has been cheating on all of them.
all three women decide to take revenge on him together. kate spikes his smoothies with estrogen pills to swell his nipples, has their dog lick his toothbrush before soaking it in their toilet, and adds hair-removal cream into his shampoo. carly spikes his water with a laxative to cause him to defecate heavy diarrhea. amber uses an ugly drag queen sexual partner against him.
in the course of carrying out the women's vicious pranks, they also discover that mark has been embezzling money from various startup companies that his workplace helps develop. meanwhile, carly begins to connect romantically and feel a bond with phil. the women's camaraderie begins to fall apart when kate finds herself still in love with mark after caving and having sex with him. carly exposes mark's fraud before texting him, upsetting kate and amber.
later, mark goes to the bahamas on a supposed business trip, and kate decides to follow and expose him. when she arrives she is surprised to find carly and amber at the airport, who explain that mark has set up kate as the owner of the companies he defrauded, which, were his fraud to be discovered, would result in kate going to prison rather than him. kate also finds out that mark has been seeing yet another woman, someone he has met on this trip. this, and the possibility of her facing prison, motivates her to take action, with the help of carly's legal expertise. amber also confides to carly that she is seeing someone else as well.
when mark returns from the vacation, he visits carly at her office. he is locked in a conference room by her assistant and friend, lydia (nicki minaj), and is stunned to see his wife, his girlfriend and his summer fling sitting in there together. they proceed to confront him with his infidelities and embezzlement. with carly as her attorney, kate presents divorce papers and a list of their assets. she reveals how she, having been named ceo by mark, has returned all of his embezzled money to the companies he stole it from from, saving both of them from prison time but leaving him bankrupt, much to his shock and hysterical outrage. mark's former business partner nick (david thornton) then arrives and acknowledges kate's work while firing him.
mark leaves, fuming, and the three women all applaud one another; as he rushes away in a huff, he smashes into an empty room's glass paneling, drastically cutting himself and ripping his coat. he exits to find his car being towed away before receiving a departing punch in the face from frank.
in the film's epilogue, kate takes over mark's job with nick and becomes ceo of several successful companies, making big profits under her honest leadership. carly and phil have fallen in love and are now expecting a child. amber and frank are now a couple and are traveling the world together. the film ends with the three women toasting to their friendship and promising to never sleep with the same guy ever again.

michael sragow of orange county register gave the film grade c, saying that the film is "a coarse, rickety comedy." richard corliss wrote for time magazine that "all three women are less watchable and amusing than nicki minaj as carly's legal assistant lydia." film critic stephen holden of the new york times said that the film is "so dumb, lazy, clumsily assembled and unoriginal, it could crush any actor forced to execute its leaden slapstick gags and mouth its crude, humorless dialogue." james berardinelli of reelviews wondered, "has it come to this for director nick cassavetes?", comparing his career negatively to that of his father, john cassavetes. berardinelli elaborated, "what a comedown to find him in charge of such an unfocused, unfunny, scatologically-obsessed 'comedy.'" christy lemire of rogerebert.com gave the film two out of four stars and said, "while "the other woman" raises some thoughtful questions about independence, identity and the importance of sisterhood, ultimately it would rather poop on them and then throw them through a window in hopes of the getting the big laugh." wesley morris of grantland said, "no one knows which takes are funny and which aren't. more than once, all three women, especially poor upton, are caught looking like they don't know what they're doing."bilge ebiri of the magazine new york said, "you can't shake the feeling that in a just world, all these women  even kate upton  would have better material than this." connie ogle of the miami herald gave the film three out of four stars and called the film a "goofy, ridiculous, with more gross-out humor than is strictly necessary but still funny. it falls into the category of girlfriend films  as in, go with your girlfriends and leave your date/partner/spouse at home with the playstation or the nba playoffs." colin covert of star tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying "it's an escapist women's empowerment comedy like many others, but elevated by the simple virtue of being, for most of its length, very, very funny." ann hornaday of the washington post gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying "a movie as generic and forgettable as the sofa-size art on its characters' walls." linda holmes wrote for npr, calling the film "a conceptually odious, stupid-to-the-bone enterprise ..." betsy sharkey of the los angeles times advised guys to "step away from the vehicle, because the other woman is out of control and intent on running down a certain kind of male."
