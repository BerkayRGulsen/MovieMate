== plot ==
a widowed king marries an evil witch named clementianna, the most beautiful woman in the land. one day, the king leaves to fight a great evil that has invaded the land, but never returns; clementianna rules in his absence, while confining her young stepdaughter, snow white, to the palace.
10 years later, snow white desires to explore the kingdom and sneaks out. walking through the forest, she meets the visiting prince andrew alcott, a prince from the kingdom of valencia, who has been robbed by a band of dwarves; she and the prince become smitten with each other. snow white arrives in the town, and finds the people are destitute due to the queen's heavy taxation.
meanwhile, clementianna is introduced to alcott and plans to marry him for his wealth. clementianna throws a ball to woo the prince, and snow white secretly attends, planning to ask the prince to help her restore the kingdom. the queen notices them dancing and orders her manservant brighton to take the princess into the forest and feed her to the beast. brighton leaves snow white in the forest, and she flees the beast, collapsing at the door to the dwarves' hideout; the dwarves take her in and introduce themselves as grimm, butcher, wolf, napoleon, half pint, grub, and chuck. when brighton collects more taxes levied by the queen to pay for her expensive parties, the dwarves rob him. snow white takes the money and returns it to the townspeople, crediting the dwarves, whom the people hail as heroes.
clementianna informs alcott that snow white is dead. when the prince finds out that the bandits have robbed brighton, he goes after them. in the forest, alcott discovers that snow white is alive and in league with the dwarves, who have trained her in combat. each believing the other to be in the wrong, snow white and alcott duel. alcott returns to the palace defeated and informs the queen that snow white is alive.
clementianna enters her mirror house, within which lives her reflection, the mirror queen. clementianna has the mirror queen temporarily turn brighton into a cockroach, and requests a love potion so she can make the prince fall in love with her. the potion turns out to be a 'puppy love' potion and the prince becomes devoted to her like a puppy dog. under this spell, the prince agrees to marry her. using dark magic, the queen attacks snow white and the dwarves with two giant marionettes; but snow white defeats them by finding and cutting their strings.
on the day of her wedding, clementianna arrives to find that snow white and the dwarves have robbed the party and abducted the prince; for her inability to handle bandits and for lying about snow white's death, the aristocrats demand the queen be deposed. back in the forest, snow white manages to break the spell on alcott with a kiss.
snow white encounters clementianna, who sends the beast after her. prince alcott tries to save snow white, but the beast captures her. however, the beast hesitates in killing her and snow white sees that it wears a necklace with a moon charm on it similar to the one the queen wears. snow white cuts the necklace off, breaking clementiannas spell, and restoring the beast to its true form: snow whites father. clementianna begins to age rapidly; the mirror queen explains this is the price for using dark magic.
grateful to alcott for his assistance, the king agrees to let him marry snow white. at the wedding, a hooded crone appears and offers snow white an apple as a wedding gift. at first, snow white accepts the apple; but, as she is about to bite it, she realizes that the crone is clementianna. snow white cuts a piece from the apple and gives it to clementianna, who reluctantly accepts it. the mirror house shatters declaring it snow white's story after all. snow white and the dwarves live happily ever after.

== casting ==
roberts was the first to be cast, because very early on tarsem singh wanted an evil queen with whom audiences could relate. he stated that in the film, the queen is not evil, but rather insecure. he also suggested that the queen's true ugliness may be revealed at the very end of the film. originally saoirse ronan was considered for the role of snow white but the age difference between her and armie hammer was too large (he was 25 and she was 17). felicity jones was offered the part but turned it down. collins was eventually cast in the role. collins said in an interview that her casting happened in 24 hours after she met tarsem singh and read for him. hammer was cast as the prince who is at first drawn towards the queen and then towards snow white. he beat out james mcavoy and alex pettyfer for the role.

=== reception ===

the film received generally mixed reviews. review aggregator rotten tomatoes gives the film a rating of 50% with an average score of 5.64/10 based on reviews from 197 critics. the site's general consensus is that "like most of tarsem singh's films, mirror mirror is undeniably beautiful  but its treatment of the age-old snow white fable lacks enough depth or originality to set it apart from the countless other adaptations of the tale." on metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, it has an average score of 46 from the 34 reviews, which indicates "mixed or average reviews".robbie collin from british newspaper the telegraph gave the film four stars describing it as "an exuberantly charming fairy story that owes as much to the gnarled folk tale illustrations of arthur rackham as the stagey, saturated lunacy of that half-loved, half-feared east german fantasy the singing ringing tree. it's a grimm piece of work, but far from a grim one: without rehashing the seminal disney animated version, it radiates gorgeousness and good humour with a near-nuclear intensity." collin praised costume designer eiko ishioka's work, saying "every outfit in mirror mirror is a masterpiece". he concluded the film is "the opposite of tim burton's brash, chaotic, dispiritingly popular alice in wonderland: here, the artistry of the cast and crew leaps off the screen, not 3d computer graphics."
