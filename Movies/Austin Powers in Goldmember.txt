== plot ==
in 2002, from his lair behind the hollywood sign, dr. evil unveils to number 2, mini-me, frau farbissina, and scott evil that his plan for world domination is to travel back in time to 1975 and partner with the dutch, gold obsessed johan van der smut, who after losing his genitalia in a smelting accident, is known by the alias "goldmember". goldmember developed a power unit for a tractor beam which dr. evil names "preparation h" and he intends to use it to pull a meteor into the earth. austin powers and the ministry of defence invade the lair and arrest dr. evil and mini-me. queen elizabeth ii knights austin for his service, but austin is disappointed when his father, the famous spy nigel powers, does not attend the event. during an after party, basil exposition informs austin that nigel has been kidnapped and the only clue is that the crew of his yacht have had their genitalia painted gold (a reference to goldfinger and the fate of jill masterson).
austin visits the imprisoned dr. evil who antagonizes him by reminding austin that his father was also absent when he was given the title of "international man of mystery" during their british intelligence academy graduation; an event that angered dr. evil due to him being the top of the class. he tells him that goldmember is behind the abduction so austin time travels to 1975 and infiltrates goldmember's roller disco club. he is reunited with his former lover, fbi agent foxxy cleopatra who is undercover. austin locates his father but is unable to rescue him and goldmember takes nigel through dr. evil's time machine to 2002. dr. evil and mini-me instigate a riot in their prison, allowing them to escape. a british intelligence mole named number 3 informs austin that dr. evil has moved to a new lair near tokyo.
austin, accompanied by foxxy, travels to tokyo and they confront fat bastard, who is now a sumo wrestler. fat bastard reveals that businessman mr. roboto is working on a device for dr. evil and goldmember. austin and foxxy meet with roboto, who pleads ignorance. austin and foxxy infiltrate roboto's factory where the command unit for the tractor beam is being loaded in goldmember's car, and roboto gives goldmember a golden key needed to activate the beam. foxxy confronts goldmember while austin attempts to free nigel, but goldmember escapes and flees to dr. evil's submarine. scott evil presents dr. evil with sharks with laser beams attached to their heads, a request that had gone unfulfilled previously. roboto then dies when scott causes him to fall into the shark pool. dr. evil replaces mini-me with scott as his favored son and the rejected clone defects and joins austin and foxxy.
the trio infiltrate the submarine but austin is captured. dr. evil prepares to activate the tractor beam, but foxxy steals the key and frees austin. austin prepares to shoot dr. evil, when nigel appears and reveals that austin and dr. evil are brothers. confused, dr. evil explains that his parents died in a car accident and he was brought up by evil belgians, but nigel reveals that the explosion came from an assassination attempt and he thought that only austin survived. dr. evil (revealed to be named dougie), austin, nigel, and mini-me embrace; enraging scott, who leaves to pursue his own vengeance while goldmember commandeers the tractor beam's controls, unzipping his trousers to reveal his gold-covered genitalia to be a spare key. goldmember activates the tractor beam, but austin and dr. evil work together to reverse its polarity, destroying the meteor and saving the world. 
goldmember turns to the camera to reveal the entire story was adapted into a film called austinpussy and was directed by steven spielberg, starring tom cruise as austin, kevin spacey as dr. evil, danny devito as mini-me, and john travolta as goldmember. upon exiting the cinema, austin and foxxy encounter fat bastard, now thin but with sagging flesh thanks to the subway diet. as austin and foxxy kiss, scott evil  now completely bald, dressed and behaving as his father, declares he will get his revenge against austin before dancing like michael jackson. during the end credits, mini-me is shown talking with britney spears, and she asks him if she can give him her mobile phone number which he accepts, and a montage of the film is shown, with burt bacharach singing "what the world needs now is love."

=== title concerns ===
the title of the film, goldmember, led to legal action being taken by mgm, the distributors of the james bond film franchise, that briefly led to the film's title being removed from promotional material and trailers. the dispute was quickly resolved and the film title remained unchanged on the provision that the film would include trailers in its cinema releases for the then-upcoming james bond film, die another day, and the lord of the rings: the two towers.


=== characters ===
austin powers (myers), having conquered the 1990s and the 1960s, travels back to the 1970s and teams up with his nemesis dr. evil (also played by myers) to thwart a new villain, goldmember (myers once again). myers also plays fat bastard for the second time, this time parodying the kind of "wire fight" seen in crouching tiger, hidden dragon. the film also stars beyonc knowles as foxxy cleopatra (parodying blaxploitation heroines, primarily foxy brown and cleopatra jones, as well as christie love when she says, "you're under arrest, sugah!"), michael york, reprising the role of basil exposition, and verne troyer in his second appearance as mini-me. the film also introduced a new character named number 3 (a.k.a. the mole), who is portrayed by former child star fred savage. clint howard plays a radar operator in all three films. michael caine guest stars as austin's father, nigel; this role was inspired by the character of harry palmer from the ipcress file, a 1965 film starring caine.four actors who appeared in the earlier films play different characters in goldmember. rob lowe, who played the friend of a dead guard in international man of mystery, reprises his role as a younger number 2 from the spy who shagged me, while neil mullarkey (quartermaster clerk in international man of mystery) and eric winzenried (army private soldier in the spy who shagged me) appear as the physician and henchman sailor in the sick bay. michael mcdonald (the virtucon guard who got run over by a steamroller in international man of mystery and a nato soldier in the spy who shagged me) appears as the royal guard.


==== goldmember ====
johan van der smut, better known as goldmember, is a fictional villain played by myers (john travolta plays the character in a cameo at the end of the film). the name was inspired by the james bond villain auric goldfinger. goldmember's dutch origins and character traits were, according to myers, inspired by an episode of the hbo tv series real sex featuring a dutchman who operated a "sex barn" north of rotterdam. the man's distinct forms of expression caught myers' attention while he was writing.
