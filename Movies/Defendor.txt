after park absorbs all this, she admits his honesty is admirable. at the hearing, paul rises in the gallery to address the court, and explains that arthur is mentally underdeveloped (revealed to be fetal alcohol syndrome) and tries to persuade the judge that it is best not to be too harsh. the judge agrees on the condition arthur doesn't become defendor again. a reporter approaches paul and convinces him to let her run a story about arthur as defendor, and he agrees. people are inspired by defendor's attempts to save lives and fight crime.

defendor manages to subdue the henchmen, but is shot repeatedly by kristic. arthur accuses him of killing his mother, and kristic recognizes her name, implying he truly was responsible for her death. as arthur lies dying, kat runs to help him. she promises to stop smoking crack and get a job. in an earlier conversation, kat had revealed she had always had a talent in writing, which arthur had described as being "like lois lane". she promises to be like her as arthur dies in her arms.
