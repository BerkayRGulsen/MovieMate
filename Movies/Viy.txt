== production ==
in 2006, russian producer alexey petrukhin and russian director oleg stepchenko decided that they wanted to make a film based on the horror story of viy by nikolai gogol. by then, two other projects based on gogol's tale were in production, such as taras bulba film from 2009 and the witch from 2006.in order to secure the title, they needed without any further delay to release the information on the forthcoming project. in the course of three days, they filmed a teaser trailer where the role of khoma brutus was played by petrukhin himself. only after that did the active production of the film begin. when the teaser was shown in theaters, the script was not yet written and the actors were not cast. the story kept growing and changing until it turned from a simple screen version into a big-budget fantasy thriller.the authors understood that the new times set new rules, so in 2011 they made a difficult but very important decision: they decided re-shoot the picture in 3d, even though half of the footage was already filmed. conversion was out of the question. the decision to re-shoot was not just a pr trick. the re-shooting was taken seriouslythe producers developed an innovative technology that had no parallels in the world.viy is an intersection of two storylines. one is the narrative from nikolai gogol's horror story. the writers used the first edition of the story still untouched by belinskiy's proofs. the original version has quite different motifs and the whole narrative focuses on a different kind of drama. what's more important, this version abounds in secrets and riddles. thus, gogol's immortal story will be screened without cuts. the second storyline is centered on a real personguillaume le vasseur de beauplan (15951685)a french traveler and cartographer who was the first to study the ukrainian territories and their people and culture. his research is included in the book from transylvania to muscovy. the producers chose his figure because he was also the first to collect and systematize under one cover slavic myths and legends. de beauplan was a prototype of the film's main characterjonathan green.
