a dark reflection was made largely by volunteers with funding from unions, passenger groups and concerned aviation figures. it is said to be based on actual events surrounding the issue of aerotoxic syndrome. 


== plot ==
after journalist eastman (georgina sutcliffe) returns home after a disastrous assignment in the middle east, she finds a new job at a local newspaper to be closer to her friend, joe forbes (t.j. herbert), an air traffic controller. following an near mid-air collision involving jasp airlines flight 313, joe has been suspended. he contends that the pilot was being slow to obey the orders of the tower.
this incident does not appear in the press, which intrigues helen. she convinces her new boss, nick robertson (paul antony-barber), that a cover-up has taken place. natasha stevens (rita ramnani) joins helen in the investigation of the air safety issues involved. they soon learn the jasp airlines company officer, david morris (stephen tompkinson), has died, but his wife, a flight attendant, discovers that he has been investigating the same concerns about air safety for years.
the new director of jasp air, ben tyrell (mark dymond), discovers that the incident of flight 313 is not the first and begins to ask his own questions. when the chief engineer of the company tells him that the pressurization of the aircraft has a design problem, letting vaporized oils pass into the cabin air'
ultimately, the dark side of the aviation industry is exposed with incidents of contaminated air as far back as the 1950s. the pervasive industry denial campaign is supported by the owners of the jasp airline company, charles (nicholas day) and maggie jasper (marina sirtis). ben has to deal with a moral issue: corporate profit or public safety?
meanwhile, helen and natasha understand that the flight crew, but also the passengers, are at risk. they would like to make a scoop, but their opponent, the aviation industry, is a major opponent, not hesitating to buy the silence of its detractors.
at an aviation conference, however, the director of jasp air indicates that the company's aircraft will begin to be modified so that the air in their cabin is of good quality.

== public awareness ==
following his own journey from british airways, to film producer and director, it has always been tristan loraine's ambition to raise awareness of the issues involving toxic air. after being forced to retire due to ill health, and losing friends, both pilots and crew who died from the poisonous fumes on board the aircraft they flew, tristan has sought to bring aerotoxic syndrome to the attention of the public. the concept of toxic cabin air has been of interest to the media for some years,. in may 2014 the daily telegraph shared a video of a passenger who suffered health issues after taking an american flight. it is argued that the cause of the toxic air comes from the plane build, which brings bleed air into the aircraft cabin and cockpit via the engines; this has the potential for a bleed air leak. a dark reflection follows several documentary films also produced by fact not fiction films seeking to bring this issue to the fore. the film's tagline, "what happened on flight 313?" links to a real event.


== film-makers welcome new aircraft design ==
the producers of a dark reflection are keen to promote the bleed free aircraft, such as the boeing 787 dreamliner, which is the first of its kind. yet despite it being released in 2007, with the telegraph calling it, "a breath of fresh air", in 2009, there have been no moves since by the airline industry to remodel any other aircraft.


== flight mh370 ==
a dark reflection has been likened to the events of the missing malaysian airlines flight mh370. however, the airline flight mh370 disappeared on 8 march 2014, which was after the filming of a dark reflection, which took place during the summer of 2013. although there is no deliberate link to the film and disappearance of mh370, it has not been said that there couldn't be some significant similarity.
