== plot ==

in 2012, benghazi in libya is named one of the most dangerous places in the world, and countries have pulled their diplomatic offices out of the country in fear of an attack by militants. the united states still has a diplomatic compound, not an official consulate, open in the city. less than a mile away is a cia outpost, "the annex," which is protected by a team of private military contractors from global response staff (grs). new to the detail is jack silva, who arrives in benghazi and is picked up by tyrone "rone" woods, the commander of the grs team and a personal friend of silva. arriving at the annex, silva is introduced to the rest of the grs team and the cia chief of station, who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens.
prior to the us ambassador's arrival, the grs team members visit the special mission, where the ambassador will be staying. they review the location and warn its diplomatic security (ds) agents about the risk of minimal-security arrangements and the high probability of a surprise attack due its volatile circumstances. us ambassador chris stevens arrives in benghazi to maintain diplomatic connections amid the political and social chaos, with limited protection from five ds agents, principally scott wickland and dave ubben, along with guards hired from the local february 17th martyrs brigade militia, nicknamed "17-feb." on the morning of the eleventh anniversary of the september 11 attacks, stevens notices suspicious men taking pictures of the compound and notifies his security detail. back at the annex, silva finds out that his wife is pregnant.
that night, a group of militants from ansar al-sharia assault the compound. the 17-feb guards are quickly overrun, which allows the attackers easy access to the compound. wickland takes stevens and smith, an it specialist, to the safe room. unable to breach the safe room, the attackers set the building on fire hoping to burn the men out. wickland escapes but loses both stevens and smith. at the annex, the grs team desperately wants to go to the compound to help, but the chief refuses for fear that the team's departure would expose the annex. however, the team dispatches to the compound and meets up with the ds agents. silva and woods enter the building searching for stevens and smith but find only smith's body. after an intense firefight inside the compound against the militants, the ds team retreats, but after wickland goes in the wrong way, they are followed by militants on their way back to the annex. later, the grs team also retreats to the annex.
knowing that an attack by the militants is imminent, the cia staff of the annex makes several desperate calls for help, but only glen "bub" doherty, a grs officer in tripoli, helps. he forms a team, including two delta operators, that flies to benghazi after several delays. meanwhile, the grs team fends off the militants as they try to breach the annex perimeter. after repelling the largest attack wave, the annex receives word from isr that help is coming.
the tripoli grs reinforcements arrive and begin to prepare the cia and ds staff for their departure to the airport. the militants launch a mortar attack in which ds agent ubben and grs team member geist are wounded, and geist's left arm is partially severed. woods rushes to aid geist and is killed by another mortar round. doherty is also killed when a third mortar detonates directly in front of him.
with the grs team compromised and the annex now vulnerable, the remaining grs operators watch as a convoy of vehicles rolls toward the annex. fearing the worst, the operators prepare to make a final stand until it is revealed that the convoy is an element of the libya shield force militia that is escorting the grs reinforcements. they also find out that stevens had been found behind the compound but was pronounced dead at the hospital.
at the airport, the cia staff and the wounded geist board the plane to tripoli while the remainder of the grs team waits for the next plane with the bodies of stevens, smith, woods, and doherty. closing titles reveal that all of the surviving members of the annex security team received contractor medals at a private ceremony, have since retired from the grs team, and live with their families and that geist saved his arm after several surgeries.

=== critical response ===
13 hours received mixed reviews from critics, though some viewed it as a welcomed tame effort from michael bay. on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 51% based on 222 reviews, with an average rating of 5.60/10 against an audience approval rating of 82%. the site's consensus reads, "13 hours: the secret soldiers of benghazi is a comparatively mature and restrained effort from michael bay, albeit one that can't quite boast the impact its fact-based story deserves." on metacritic the film has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "a" on an a+ to f scale.soren andersen, writing for the seattle times, gave the film 3 stars out of 4, criticizing the lack of distinctive characters but ultimately summarizing 13 hours as "engrossing" and "a ground-level depiction of heroism in the midst of the fog of war". richard roeper similarly praised 13 hours in his review for the chicago sun-times. although he lamented the script, roeper found the film to be a "solid action thriller with well-choreographed battle sequences and strong work from the ensemble cast". like roeper's review, new york daily news' joe dziemianowicz was less receptive toward the script, but applauded the film's focus on the real-life attack, summarizing: "war is gritty here, not glamorous... [michael bay] delivers a gripping, harrowing, and heartfelt film."in a mixed review, inkoo kang of thewrap praised 13 hours for its action scenes, but panned bay's direction as "myopic". she writes, "13 hours is the rare michael bay movie that wasn't made with teenage boys in mind. but that doesn't make his latest any less callously juvenile." lindsey bahr of the associated press was critical of the film's direction and cinematography, and found the screenplay to be confusing. similarly, the economist described the film as "a sleek, poorly scripted and largely meaningless film".


=== libyan response ===
the film caused controversy in libya.  many libyans believed it ignored the contributions of local people who attempted to save the us ambassador. libya's foreign ministry spokesman, salah belnaba, denounced the film's portrayal of the libyan people and described it as "fanatical and ignorant." culture and information minister, omar gawaari, also criticized the film saying: "the movie shows the us contractors who actually failed to secure the ambassador [...] as heroes", adding that michael bay "turned america's failure to protect its own citizens in a fragile state into a typical action movie all about american heroism".


=== accolades ===
at the 89th academy awards, 13 hours received a nomination for best sound mixing. however, greg p. russell (one of the four nominees from the film) had his nomination rescinded when it was discovered that he had contacted voters for the award by telephone in violation of campaigning regulations.


== historical accuracy ==
the film's historical accuracy has been disputed. in the film's most controversial scene, the cia chief in benghazi (identified only as "bob") tells the military contractors there when they seek permission to go defend the embassy to "stand down" and thus denies them permission. the real-life cia chief stated that there was no stand-down order, but multiple sources who were willing to identify themselves have refuted the still-unnamed cia chief. however, no help was sent even though officials at the highest levels had found out about the attack within the first few hours out of the 13. also, the national review commentator david french argues that the senate committee cited above found plenty of evidence of the "stand down" order in the form of personal testimony from multiple witnesses but chose to rule that the contrary testimony outweighed it.kris "tanto" paronto, a cia contractor who was involved in action during the event, said, "we were told to 'stand down'. those words were used verbatim100 percent. if the truth of it affects someone's political career? well, i'm sorry. it happens." the cia base chief portrayed in the film has directly contradicted paronto's claims, saying "there never was a stand-down order.... at no time did i ever second-guess that the team would depart."also disputed is the film's portrayal that air support was denied. a house armed services committee report found that air support was unavailable or that it would have arrived too late to make a difference. french defended the film's references to air support by writing that even if resources could not have been flown in during the time available, that would itself have been "scandalous" because of libya's known instability. in july 2016, the republican-led house select committee on benghazi released its report that included numerous witnesses indicating that u.s. military help was available but not called upon. the report indicated the department of defense would not provide the requested list of military assets available that night.
