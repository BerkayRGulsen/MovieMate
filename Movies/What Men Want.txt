helen o'hara of empire wrote "the storytelling is a little loose, but as a workplace comedy with a side-line in romance, this earns its laughs thanks to the immensely game henson and a stellar supporting cast."
peter travers of rolling stone gave it 2 out of 5, was critical of the script, "henson looks ready to come out firing on all cylinders, but the comic cowardice of what men want leaves her shooting blanks." variety's owen gleiberman compares the film to the original, saying that it was based on the idea that women are smarter than men believe, but the premise of the remake is that men are as bad or worse than the stereotypes, which he doesn't object to but says it "holds a distinct disadvantage as comedy" and that as a result the overheard thoughts lack "the snap of comic surprise".
