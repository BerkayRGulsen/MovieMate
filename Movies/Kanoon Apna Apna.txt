== plot ==
the collector of anokhapur, jagatpratap singh (dilip kumar) is a stickler for law and order. however, his son, ravi (sanjay dutt) believes that sometimes illegal means may be adopted in order to assert control. this causes conflict between the two. bhushannath bhadbole (kader khan) and kabza kanhaiyalal (anupam kher) are corrupt ministers. their sons, kailash (gulshan grover) and prakash (tej sapru) respectively, rape and kill jagatpratap's maid-servant and also kill ravi's friend. they are acquitted because they gave fake alibis. ravi decides to give these criminals the punishment they deserve. as ravi knows this will cause a conflict with his father, he decides to leave home. he then becomes a police inspector. this does not heal the father-son bond as he still has different ideas about the meaning of justice. after deliberating on the statement that "the law is for human beings but not for monsters", the father finally agrees to join his son in his fight against the corrupt ministers.
