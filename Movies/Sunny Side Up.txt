== plot ==

the film centres around a will-they won't-they romance. wealthy jack cromwell from long island runs off to new york city on account of his fiancee's relentless flirting. he attends an independence day block party where molly carr, from yorkville, manhattan, falls in love with him. comic relief is provided by grocer eric swenson, above whose shop molly and her flatmate, bea nichols, live. gaynor performs a charming singing and dancing version of the song "(keep your) sunny side up" for a crowd of her neighbors, complete with top hat and cane.  later in the film, a lavish pre-code dance sequence for the song "turn on the heat", including scantily clad and gyrating island women enticing bananas on trees to abruptly grow and stiffen, with the graphic metaphor lost on no one, occurs without gaynor's participation.

== music ==


=== "i'm a dreamer, aren't we all?" ===
several times throughout the film gaynor sings the tune "i'm a dreamer, aren't we all?" and, on one occasion, sings it impressively, according to the new york times. the credits are: words, de sylva & brown; music, ray henderson.
the song was punned by the marx brothers in the film animal crackers (1930). groucho asks his brother to "play the song about montreal". chico asks, "montreal?, and groucho replies, "i'm a dreamer, montreal."  the pun has been much-recycled  not least in stewart parker's award-winning play im a dreamer, montreal.
an early popular recording was by paul whiteman and his orchestra on october 16, 1929 with a vocal group including bing crosby  and this reached the charts in 1929. the tune was also recorded by john coltrane in 1958  and included on his album bahia (1964).


=== "turn on the heat" ===
in addition to appearing in the sunny side up, "turn on the heat" was recorded as a solo stride piano piece by fats waller in 1929, and this recording has been reissued numerous times. the song was also used in the 1933 pooch the pup cartoon hot and cold.


=== "(keep your) sunny side up" ===
another song in the film that would later be used as the theme song to the 1988 british sitcom clarence.
in the 1950s, the song was used as the theme song for sunnyside up, a variety program produced by hsv-7 (a television station in melbourne, australia). the song's melody was later adapted by the essendon football club for its club song, "see the bombers fly up", written by kevin andrews in 1959.a 1929 recording of the song by johnny hamp's kentucky serenaders plays during the closing credits of the 1973 film paper moon.
