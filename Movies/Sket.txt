== plot ==

the manga focuses on the (mis)adventures of kaimei high school's campus support club, the sket dance (katakana: ""; kanji: ""; transliteration: "suketto dan"; translation: "helper's club"; included english acronym: "sket (support, kindness, encouragement, and troubleshoot)"). dedicated to the general improvement of campus life, the sket dance is devoted to solving any and all problems submitted by the staff or student body. however, due to its general lack of meaningful assignments and the unglamorous reputation of being just a 'group of handymen', the sket dance is treated with widespread contempt and it is composed of only three members.
the story is told through a series of short, self-contained stories focusing on cases undertaken by the sket dan and is usually told in the space of one or two chapters. cases to date focus on a variety of issues from more humorous cases (like chasing monkeys around the school or helping a wanna-be samurai find out why he cannot win kendo tournaments) to more serious cases (like those hinting at himeko's violent past or those concerning near-terminal illness).
