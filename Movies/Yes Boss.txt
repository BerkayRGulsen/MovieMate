== plot ==
rahul (shahrukh khan) is an ambitious young, bright man who desires to become wealthy. he is lucky enough to find a job with extra earnings with his boss, siddharth (aditya pancholi), who is a lustful person having extramarital affairs. siddharth has deviously trapped a rich woman sheela (kashmira shah) and rahul earns overtime money in keeping his boss' affairs a secret.
then comes along seema (juhi chawla) an elegant and gorgeous young woman and an ambitious, aspiring model - also desiring a life of luxury. siddharth is lustfully attracted to seema and her heavenly beauty and charm and asks rahul to help him trap her too. a helpless rahul does so, but deep down somewhere in his heart, rahul has a soft spot for seema.
anyway, due to rahul's efforts, seema is impressed by siddharth's personality and business acumen. gradually, seema and siddharth become friends and she discovers siddharth's purity of heart and begins liking him when they go to switzerland for a shooting schedule.
as their companionship blossoms, rahul introduces seema to his mother (reema lagoo), who is a heart patient and is sensitive to any shocking news or stress in life. unfortunately, bhushan (gulshan grover) uses this to his advantage and to mess with rahul, and tells her that rahul has married seema. rahul's mother is overjoyed with this news.
in order to avoid shocking his mother, rahul and seema have to put up an act as if they are a happily married couple, however, both slowly fall in love in the process.
when siddharth learns that rahul is in love with seema (siddharth's new pawn) he offers rahul his dream office - with the unsaid implication that it was in return for seema. siddharth, however, has no intention of giving rahul his dream office. rahul realizes that he had been supporting siddharth's lustful habits all along for his dream office by being a bootlicker to him.
rahul replies to him and says that he does not want siddharth as his boss, nor his dream office, and seema joins him by resigning as well.
after this fiasco, true love triumphs as seema decides to let a luxurious life go and spend the rest of her life with rahul and his ailing mother who wholeheartedly accepts the relationship again, and rahul decides that he'd have a luxurious life for him and seema by his hard earned money and not by bootlicking anyone.
