always leave them laughing is a 1949 musical comedy-drama film directed by roy del ruth and starring milton berle and virginia mayo.


== plot ==
a nobody, comic kip cooper does his act on stage in asbury park, new jersey to more snores than roars. he asks out one of the performing washburn sisters for a date, and finds that fay's parents once did a vaudeville act that kip still knows by heart.
kip convinces fay to do the old act themselves. but when he's offered a solo engagement, kip grabs it, only to flop and be cheated out of his pay. he takes a small part in a show, lying to the washburns that he was hired to be the lead, and does an impromptu gag that gets him fired.
fay needs a job, so she joins the chorus of old-time comedian eddie eagen's touring show. kip takes a bit too much interest in eddie's beautiful and much younger wife, nancy, who co-stars in the revue.
kip ends up going on for eddie during an illness, and then becomes his replacement. eddie attempts a comeback when the show gets to new york, but collapses on stage. kip's career takes off after that, but what he wants most is for fay to take him back.
