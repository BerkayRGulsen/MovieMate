== production ==
brown had wanted to break into hollywood but not succeeded until he sold doorway to hell. he then wrote skyline and persuaded fox to let him direct. the film was also known as hoodlum.the film gave an early role to george raft who had been spotted dancing by director rowland brown. according to the los angeles times "brown was looking for menace with sex appeal" and raft was filming the day after brown first saw him. (another account says raft was recommended to brown by owney madden.) the fact that this was raft's first major role in a narrative feature film accounts for his low billing (seventh in the cast) despite the large size of his supporting part. raft played an extremely similar role the following year in scarface (1932) starring paul muni, which catapulted his career into stardom.


== reception ==
the los angeles times called it "unrelieved, unrelenting... gray and cold and harsh."the new york times said it was "endowed with originality and suspense" and was "exceeding well directed and ably acted."according to filmink magazine "raft was chosen for his 'seductive menace' and it was a decent part  flirting with girls, bumping off fellow gangsters, being shot down by tracy. raft wasn't much of a technical actor  he never would be, not really  but he had swarthy good looks, moved with a dancer's grace and brought authenticity to any role that involved speakeasies, shoot outs and nightclubs."
