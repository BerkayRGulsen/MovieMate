in south africa, where three nuns clara, mary, and hilde arrive at a plantation where they are to give aid. clara who is very head-strong goes to great lengths to look after the family of a young rape victim, whose grandmother has died, and who is cared for by her older brother. she asks for help from the plantation owner hallyday, who makes sexual advances on her. eventually she gives in and allows hallyday to have sex with her, if he agrees to help the family she looks after. she eventually discovers that the older brother in the family is re-using the plantation's needles, effectively spreading infections amongst the people who live and work there. following this, three men break into the nuns' bedroom and rape them. the nuns leave the plantation soon after, but as the car pulls away, clara gets out and walks back to the plantation, removing her habit as she goes.
the epilogue is narrated by hilde, who is revealed to be a saint and has heard the prayers of everyone from the three stories detailed above. she wonders why the human race will not unite in the face of their common enemy, aids, and decides that god, or at least the way people believe in him, is to blame for this failure.
