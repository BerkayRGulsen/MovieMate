== reception ==
the film performed disappointingly at the box office. jonathan chissick, managing director of hoyts, said "i thought it was the best script to come out of australia. so, we failed there somewhere. i don't want to point my finger but there was obviously a failure."the coolangatta gold was parodied by the australian comedy troupe the d-generation in the 1993 season of the late show. the sketch "the last aussie auteur: a tribute to filmmaker warren perso" features excerpts from various (fictional) australian films, one being a box-office flop titled the bermagui bronze.
