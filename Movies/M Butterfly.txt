== plot ==
loosely based on true events (see bernard boursicot and shi pei pu), the film concerns ren gallimard (jeremy irons), a french diplomat assigned to beijing, china, in the 1960s. he becomes infatuated with a peking opera performer, song liling (john lone), who spies on him for the government of the people's republic of china. their affair lasts for 20 years and they subsequently marry, with gallimard all the while apparently unaware (or willfully ignorant) of the fact that in peking opera, dan roles are traditionally performed by men.

== themes ==
one theme of the film (as with the play) is orientalist stereotypes, but cronenberg removed many of the political overtones from the story in order to focus more intensely on the relationship between gallimard and song. a key line in the film is "only a man knows how a woman is supposed to act."
