== plot ==
miami-born carl casper is the head chef of gauloise in brentwood, los angeles. while popular with his kitchen staff and hostess molly, carl clashes with the restaurant's owner, riva, who wants him to stick to "classics" rather than innovative dishes. carl has a strained relationship with his tech-savvy preteen son, percy, and rich ex-wife, inez.
when carl has the chance to serve prestigious food critic and blogger ramsey michel, riva demands he prepare old favorites at the last minute; carl concedes, leading to a scathing review. carl insults ramsey on twitter, not realizing that his reply is public, and gains a large online following. carl comes up with a new menu that his staff loves and invites ramsey to a "rematch", but leaves after confronting riva, who wants the old menu again.
at home, carl prepares the menu he wanted, while his sous-chef tony serves ramsey the same dishes from his prior visit. ramsey tweets negatively about carl, causing carl to confront him at the restaurant and publicly backflip. videos of carl's meltdown go viral, leaving him humiliated and unemployable.
carl reluctantly accepts inez's invitation to accompany her and percy to miami, where he rediscovers his love for cuban cuisine. at inez's encouragement, her ex-husband marvin offers carl a dilapidated food truck. carl and percy bond while restoring the truck and buying groceries, and carl gives him a chef's knife. martin, carl's friend and former line cook, turns down his promotion at gauloise to join carl, who has reignited his passion as a chef.
carl, martin, and percy drive the truck across the country to los angeles, serving cuban sandwiches and yuca fries. percy promotes them on social media, and they find success in new orleans and austin, where their daily specials include po' boys and barbecued brisket, made with local ingredients.
back in los angeles, having strengthened his relationship with percy, carl accepts his son's offer to help with the food truck. ramsey visits the truck to explain his bad review: though an early fan of carl, he was disappointed by a meal he felt was beneath carl's skills. impressed with the chef's return to form, ramsey offers to bankroll a new restaurant where carl will have full creative control.
six months later, the successful new restaurant is closed for a private event: carl and inez's remarriage ceremony.

== production ==


=== development ===
jon favreau, the writer, director and star of chef, wrote the film's script in about two weeks. he had long wanted to make a film about food and chefs, and felt that the subject was suited to a small-scale independent film rather than a big-budget production. he cited jiro dreams of sushi, eat drink man woman and big night as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.the script was semi-autobiographical, incorporating parts of favreau's life into the main character, such as being a father while having a busy career and coming from a "broken home". favreau also drew a comparison between his career as a director and carl's career as a chef; he stepped down from directing major studio films to go "back to basics" and create chef on a smaller budget, much like carl's resignation from a popular restaurant to work in a food truck.favreau contacted roy choi, a restaurateur who created the kogi korean bbq food truck, to serve as a consultant on the film; choi was eventually promoted to co-producer. while the film was in pre-production, favreau shadowed choi in his restaurants and worked as part of choi's kitchen crew after training at a culinary school. choi oversaw the menus prepared for the film and created the cuban sandwiches that form a central part of the storyline.


=== casting ===
in addition to favreau, the first actors cast in main roles were sofa vergara, john leguizamo and bobby cannavale. to prepare for his role as martin the line cook, leguizamo spent time working as an actual line cook at the lion in the west village. it was announced that robert downey, jr.whom favreau had previously directed in two iron man filmshad joined the cast in may 2013. scarlett johansson and dustin hoffman were cast later that month. favreau felt the casting was one of the film's biggest successes, which provided him with "a tremendous amount of confidence"; in particular, he was impressed by emjay anthony, who was ten years old at the time of filming.


=== filming ===

principal photography of the film began in july 2013 in los angeles. subsequent filming took place in miami, austin and new orleanscities that favreau chose to work into the story because they all "possess a rich food and music culture". filming locations in miami included the versailles restaurant, the fontainebleau hotel, and the cuban restaurant hoy como ayer in little havana. in new orleans, some scenes were filmed at caf du monde in the city's french quarter. in austin, filming locations included franklin barbecue and guero's on south congress. filming of the shopping scene took place in los angeles at charlie's fixtures. food prepared for the shoot was eaten by the cast and crew after filming. much of the dialogue in the food truck scenes between favreau, john leguizamo, and emjay anthony was improvised in order to capture the banter of a kitchen environment.


== soundtrack ==
milan records released a chef soundtrack on may 6, 2014, three days before the film's release. the soundtrack is a combination of latin jazz, new orleans jazz and blues, which serve as background to the storyline as it moves through miami, new orleans and austin, respectively. the film's music was chosen by music supervisor mathieu schreyer, while additional incidental music was scored by lyle workman.
