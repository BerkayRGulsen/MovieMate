warhol and morrissey conceived flesh while warhol was convalescing following the attempt on his life by valerie solanas. john schlesinger was filming midnight cowboy, which featured several members of warhol's entourage, including viva and ultra violet who, with morrissey, shot a separate short film during shooting of midnight cowboy's elaborate party scene.warhol initially endorsed the participation of his people but grew resentful at what he perceived as schlesinger's poaching of warhol's scene. warhol decided to undercut schlesinger by filming his own story about a male prostitute.the film was photographed by morrissey, using a 16mm auricon camera favored by warhol for his earlier films. this camera permitted the recording of sound directly onto the film, and had a maximum run time of 33 minutes. this allowed for long improvised scenes. morrissey often included the camera's flash frames and pops, which occur when starting and stopping the camera, as an aesthetic choice.
