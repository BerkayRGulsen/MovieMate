for the role of anju roy, mehboob khan had initially cast the actress meena kumari. however, due to some reasons, kumari could not continue shooting and left the film. following kumari's departure, the shooting came to a halt; and several actresses made unsuccessful tries to achieve the high-profile role. in late 1953, raj kapoor phoned khan requesting him to cast nargis (whom kapoor was dating then) in the role. however, at this time, there was a considerable amount of lobbying from dilip kumar's side also, to take madhubala in the movie. finally, khan had to refuse to kapoor and choose madhubala on the insistence of kumar. some critics believe that madhubala's performance as anju roy was among her finest performances.
