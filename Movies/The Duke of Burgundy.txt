duke of burgundy (french: duc de bourgogne) was a title used by the rulers of the duchy of burgundy, from its establishment in 843 to its annexation by france in 1477, and later by habsburg sovereigns of the low countries (14821556).
the duchy of burgundy was a small portion of the traditional lands of the burgundians west of the river sane which, in 843, was allotted to charles the bald's kingdom of west franks. under the ancien rgime, the duke of burgundy was the premier lay peer of the kingdom of france. beginning with robert ii of france, the title was held by the capetians, the french royal family. it was granted to robert's younger son, robert, who founded the house of burgundy. when the senior line of the house of burgundy became extinct, it was inherited by john ii of france through proximity of blood. john granted the duchy to his younger son, philip the bold. the valois dukes of burgundy gradually ruled over a vast complex of territories known as the burgundian state, and became dangerous rivals to the senior line of the house of valois.
when the male line of the valois dukes of burgundy became extinct in 1477, the duchy of burgundy was confiscated by louis xi of france. the title duke of burgundy passed to habsburg monarchs via marriage. the habsburgs used it to have a claim on burgundy proper and to rule their burgundian inheritance. today, the title is used by the house of bourbon as a revived courtesy title.

in 1477, the territory of the duchy of burgundy was annexed by france. in the same year, mary married maximilian, archduke of austria, giving the habsburgs control of the remainder of the burgundian inheritance.
although the territory of the duchy of burgundy itself remained in the hands of france, the habsburgs remained in control of the title of duke of burgundy and the other parts of the burgundian inheritance, notably the low countries and the free county of burgundy in the holy roman empire. they often used the term burgundy to refer to it (e.g. in the name of the imperial circle it was grouped into), until the late 18th century, when the austrian netherlands were lost to the french republic. the habsburgs also continued to claim burgundy proper until the treaty of cambrai in 1529, when they surrendered their claim in exchange for french recognition of imperial sovereignty over flanders and artois.
