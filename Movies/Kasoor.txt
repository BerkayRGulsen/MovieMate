kasur (urdu:  pronounced [qsur] (listen); also romanized as qasr; from arabic qasr meaning "palace") is a city to south of lahore, in the pakistani province of punjab. the city serves as the headquarters of kasur district. kasur is the 24th largest city of pakistan by population. it is also known for being the burial place of the 17th-century sufi-poet bulleh shah. it is farther west of the border with neighbouring india, and bordered to lahore, sheikhupura, and the okara district of punjab province.


== etymology ==
historically the city of kasur was named by ancient aryan tribe of kambojas who migrated from mittani and kussara and belonged to ancient king pithana of kussara. kasur derives its name from the persian and arabic word qasur (), meaning palaces, or forts. hindu traditions claim that kasur was founded by, and named for, prince kusha of the ramayana, son of the hindu deities rama and sita. according to that belief, the city was named kashawar along with its neighbouring city, lahore which was named lahawar. historical records reject an ancient mythological founding of the city and dates it back to 1525, where it was found as a fortified settlement.
