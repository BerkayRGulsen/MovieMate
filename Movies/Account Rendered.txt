== critical reception ==
the radio times called it "substandard"; whereas britmovie called it an "efficient b-movie murder mystery based on pamela barringtons 1953 pulp novel and directed by the tireless peter graham scott. the plot is fairly straightforward but entertainingly interwoven by screenwriter barbara s harper and cinematographer walter j. harvey brings an air of tension to proceedings. the cast is entirely competent but a young pre-bond honor blackman shines through."
