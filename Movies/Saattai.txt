== critical reception ==
sify's critic described the film as a "decent entertainer which harps loudly on the message it wants to convey", noting that director m anbazhgan "has neatly worked the film around [samuthira]kanis character but at times it becomes too preachy and sentimental". m. suganth from the times of india gave it 4 out of 5 and claimed that saattai was a "commercial potboiler dressed up as arty fare". the reviewer further wrote: "anbazhagan's intentions are quite commendable [...] but the sad thing is that he goes about this task with less subtlety and more sermonizing, with the result that the scenes where he wishes to make a point come across as totally preachy". similarly, malathi rangarajan from the hindu wrote: "the aim is lofty, the theme, noble. it is in execution that director anbazhagan falters a little". she concluded that the film was "at times obviously sermonising" but "still [...] worthy of notice". behindwoods's reviewer gave it 2 out of 5 and noted:  "the preachy dialogues in the film are what students listen to in real life. this is probably why the film fails to make the intended impact as there is nothing out of the box".

=== spin-off ===

in september 2015, samuthirakani chose to postpone the production of his kitna, after the lead actress dhansika got an offer to appear in pa. ranjith's kabali (2016). he chose instead to use his time directing and producing a sequel to his earlier film, saattai (2012), and revealed that the film would be titled appa. he revealed that the film would bear no resemblance to the first film, but would be a spiritual sequel and would revolve around the education system like the previous film. he initially approached anbazhagan to direct the film, but the director's commitments to making rupai produced by prabhu solomon, meant that samuthirakani directed the film himself. samuthirakani also revealed that the film's plot line had been taken from a real-life incident, which happened when choosing a school for his son.
