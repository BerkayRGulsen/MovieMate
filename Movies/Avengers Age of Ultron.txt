stark and banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete stark's "ultron" global defense program. the unexpectedly sentient ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save earth, eliminates stark's a.i. j.a.r.v.i.s. and attacks the avengers at their headquarters. escaping with the scepter, ultron uses the resources in strucker's sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. having killed strucker, he recruits the maximoffs, who hold stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons, and goes to the base of arms dealer ulysses klaue in johannesburg to get vibranium. the avengers attack ultron and the maximoffs, but wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing banner to turn into the hulk and rampage until stark stops him with his anti-hulk armor.a worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding at barton's farmhouse. thor departs to consult with dr. erik selvig on the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while nick fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop ultron. in seoul, ultron uses loki's scepter to enslave the team's friend helen cho. they use her synthetic-tissue technology, vibranium, and the scepter's gem to craft a new body. as ultron uploads himself into the body, wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the maximoffs turn against ultron. rogers, romanoff, and barton fight ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but ultron captures romanoff.
the avengers fight among themselves when stark and banner secretly upload j.a.r.v.i.s.who is still working after hiding from ultron inside the internetinto the synthetic body. thor returns to help activate the body, based on his vision that the gem on its brow is the mind stone, one of the six infinity stones, the most powerful objects in existence. this "vision" earns their trust by being worthy of lifting thor's hammer, mjlnir. vision and the maximoffs go with the avengers to sokovia, where ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. banner rescues romanoff, who awakens the hulk for the battle. the avengers fight ultron's army while fury arrives in a helicarrier with maria hill, james rhodes, and s.h.i.e.l.d. agents to evacuate civilians. pietro dies when he shields barton from gunfire, and a vengeful wanda abandons her post to destroy ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. the city plummets, but stark and thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. in the aftermath, the hulk, unwilling to endanger romanoff by being with her, departs in a quinjet, while vision confronts and seemingly destroys ultron's last remaining body.
later, with the avengers having established a new base run by fury, hill, cho, and selvig, thor returns to asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated major events. as stark leaves and barton retires, rogers and romanoff prepare to train new avengers: rhodes, vision, sam wilson, and wanda.
in a mid-credits scene, thanos, dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns, dons a gauntlet and vows to retrieve the infinity stones himself.


== cast ==

robert downey jr. as tony stark / iron man: the benefactor of the avengers who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own invention. on how his character evolves after the events of iron man 3 (2013), downey said, "i think he realizes that tweaking and making all the suits in the worldwhich is what he has been doingstill didn't work for that thing of his tour of duty that left him a little ptsd. so his focus is more on how can we make it so that there's no problem to begin with. that, you know, there's a bouncer at our planet's rope. that's the big idea."
chris hemsworth as thor: an avenger and the crown prince of asgard, based on the norse mythological deity of the same name. regarding thor's place in the film, hemsworth stated that as thor has remained on earth since thor: the dark world (2013), and has begun to feel at home here, he considers ultron's threat a personal attack. hemsworth stated that he had to work harder to bring new elements to the character to avoid repeating himself saying, "it gave us room to kind of make him a little more grounded and human and have him in some civilian clothes and mixing it up at a party." hemsworth noted that thor's motivations in this film were completely different, as it was the first mcu film where he did not play against tom hiddleston's character of loki.
mark ruffalo as bruce banner / hulk: an avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. to prepare for the role, ruffalo worked with motion capture performer andy serkis' the imaginarium. he stated that his character had grown since the previous film and was "a bit more complex". ruffalo explained that a confrontation is brewing between banner and the hulk saying, "there's a very cool thing happening: hulk is as afraid of banner as banner is afraid of hulk.. and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other." while filming in london, ruffalo said that whedon still had not given him any of the hulk's lines. whedon later explained that he writes the hulk's dialogue spontaneously, saying, "what makes the hulk so hard to write is that you're pretending he's a werewolf when he's a superhero. you want it vice versa [...] so the question is, how has he progressed? how can we bring changes on what the hulk does? and that's not just in the screenplay, that's moment to moment."
chris evans as steve rogers / captain america: the leader of the avengers and a world war ii veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. evans stated that since the fall of s.h.i.e.l.d. in captain america: the winter soldier (2014), rogers has been left to depend on his avenger teammates without the structure of military life and is now "looking to understand where he belongs, not just as a soldier, as captain america, but as steve rogers, as a person." evans said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for captain america: the winter soldier by working out up to an hour a day. regarding captain america's fighting style, evans felt he did not want to take a step back from the skills shown in the winter soldier, making sure rogers' fight style advanced, showing "a consistent display of strength", and having rogers utilizing his environment.
scarlett johansson as natasha romanoff / black widow: an avenger who formerly worked for s.h.i.e.l.d. as a highly trained spy. producer kevin feige stated that more of the character's backstory is explored in the film. johansson elaborated, "in avengers 2 we go back [...] we definitely learn more about widow's backstory, and we get to find out how she became the person you see. all of these characters have deep, dark pasts, and i think that the past catches up to some of us a little bit." regarding where the film picks up widow's story, johansson felt it was a continuation of what was seen for her character in the winter soldier, with the fact that "'[widow] never made an active choice. [she's] a product of other people's imposition.' that's going to catch up with her. that's bound to have a huge effect. there's got to be a result of that realization [...] you'll see her actively making some choices in her life, for better or worse." a mixture of close-ups, concealing costumes, stunt doubles, and visual effects were used to help hide johansson's pregnancy during filming.
jeremy renner as clint barton / hawkeye: an avenger and master archer who previously worked as an agent for s.h.i.e.l.d. whedon said that hawkeye interacts more with the other characters in the film, as opposed to the first film where the character had been "possessed pretty early by a bad guy and had to walk around all scowly." as the character did not appear in any other of marvel's phase two films, whedon stated age of ultron sheds light on to what the character was doing since the end of the avengers. renner described the character as "kind of a loner" and "a team player only 'cause he sort of has to be. he's not really a company man. captain america can be that guy. in [age of ultron] you'll understand why [hawkeye] thinks the way he thinks."
don cheadle as james "rhodey" rhodes / war machine: an officer in the u.s. air force and tony stark's close personal friend who operates the war machine armor.
aaron taylor-johnson as pietro maximoff: the twin brother of wanda who can move at superhuman speed. taylor-johnson felt pietro was defined by the fact that he and his sister were abandoned by their family, and they both had to grow up "in eastern europe defending and looking out for themselves and each other," that they both look to the other for guidance. taylor-johnson also said that quicksilver was "very overprotective" of scarlet witch and has "real anger frustration", which results in him being easily bored because of a short attention span. feige stated exploring quicksilver's relationship with his sister and his backstory growing up in eastern europe would help differentiate the character from evan peters' version in x-men: days of future past (2014). taylor-johnson stated that the running style for quicksilver went through multiple iterations. much of taylor-johnson's scenes were filmed outdoors to give "life" to his running, as opposed to running indoors in front of a green screen.
elizabeth olsen as wanda maximoff: the twin sister of pietro who can engage in hypnosis and telekinesis. olsen felt wanda was "overly stimulated" rather than "mentally insane" because "she has such a vast amount of knowledge that she's unable to learn how to control it. no one taught her how to control it properly [...] she can connect to this world and parallel worlds at the same time, and parallel times." describing her character's mind control powers, olsen said that the character is able to do more than manipulating someone's mind, with wanda maximoff able to "feel and see what they feel and see" by projecting visions that they have never seen. olsen drew on her relationship with her older brother and her sisters to prepare for the role, as well as looking to the comics for inspiration. olsen revealed that whedon was inspired by dancers as a way to visually represent how the character moves. as such, olsen mostly trained with a dancer in lieu of traditional stunt training. olsen was signed for this film and another.
paul bettany as j.a.r.v.i.s. and vision: bettany, who voiced j.a.r.v.i.s., stark's a.i. companion in previous films, was cast again as the vision, an android created by ultron. bettany stated that he was surprised when whedon asked him if he wanted to be the vision because once an actor has been cast as a particular character in the mcu, they usually are not cast as another. on what intrigued him about the vision, bettany said, "the thing that appealed to me is that this sort of nascent creature being born, being both omnipotent and totally naive, the sort of danger of that and complex nature of a thing being born that is that powerful and that created in a second and the choices he makes morally are really complex and interesting. they've really managed to maintain all of that". bettany also stated that the vision feels paternal and protective to a number of people in the film, particularly scarlet witch, and has the ability to change his density. bettany did wire work for the part. whedon stated he wanted to include the vision in a second avengers film before he signed onto the first film. bettany's make-up, which consisted of a mix of face paint and prosthetics, took two hours to apply with make-up artists jeremy woodhead and nik williams citing the correct hue of the vision's skin as the hardest thing to figure out. the prosthetics were ultimately replaced in post-production with cgi elements.
cobie smulders as maria hill: a former high-ranking s.h.i.e.l.d. agent who now works for stark. describing hill's situation in the film, smulders said that after the winter soldier, hill does not "really know who's a good guy and who's a bad guy and she's trying to figure out that throughout this film." she added, "she's not getting any sleep. she's doing all the work. she doesn't have the kind of manpower that she had in s.h.i.e.l.d.," instead working for tony stark at the avenger's headquarters "trying to keep everything running as smoothly as possible [...] it's an entirely different vibe for her."
anthony mackie as sam wilson / falcon: a former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack and a friend of steve rogers. discussing the relationship between wilson and rogers, mackie said that the two characters have a mutual "soldier respect", which is explored in the film and in captain america: civil war (2016). feige said that it was decided to reshoot the final scene of the film to incorporate the new falcon suit designed for ant-man (2015), which was released after age of ultron, as falcon was originally shot in his original suit from the winter soldier. mackie stated he did not realize wilson had become an avenger until he watched the film at the premiere, as he was only given the script for the scenes he worked on.
hayley atwell as peggy carter: a retired officer with the strategic scientific reserve and co-founder of s.h.i.e.l.d. who is a former love interest of steve rogers.
idris elba as heimdall: the all-seeing, all-hearing asgardian sentry of the bifrst bridge, based on the mythological deity of the same name.
stellan skarsgrd as erik selvig: an astrophysicist and friend of thor. skarsgrd said he was originally not supposed to appear in the film, but received a call because "they'd written a couple of scenes, and i went and did them," not knowing if the scenes would appear in the final cut of the film.
james spader as ultron: an artificial intelligence repurposed by tony stark and bruce banner for a pilot peace program that is overwhelmed with a god complex and now desires to pacify the earth by eradicating humanity. director joss whedon stated that spader was his "first and only choice" for the role, because of his "hypnotic voice that can be eerily calm and compelling" while also being very human and humorous. feige clarified that spader's face and body were motion captured "to create a whole performance [...] we did not hire james spader to do a robot voice." extensive scans were taken of spader's head and body in preparation for the role. about the character whedon said, "he's always trying to destroy the avengers, goddamn it, he's got a bee in his bonnet. he's not a happy guy, which means he's an interesting guy. he's got pain. and the way that manifests is not going to be standard robot stuff." whedon added that ultron is "not a creature of logiche's a robot who's genuinely disturbed. we're finding out what makes him menacing and at the same time endearing and funny and strange and unexpected, and everything a robot never is." whedon compared ultron to frankenstein's monster, saying, "it's our new frankenstein myth [...] we create something in our own image and the thing turns on us. it has that pain of 'well, why was i made? i want to kill daddy.'" spader called the character "self-absorbed" and added, "i think he sees the avengers as being part of a problem, a more comprehensive problem in the world. he sees the world from a very strange, [biblical] point of view because he's brand new, he's very young [...] he's immature, and yet has knowledge of comprehensive, broad history and precedent, and he has created in a very short period of time a rather skewed worldview." spader elaborates, "he truly is an artificial intelligence with absolutely no censorship at all, no parameters really [...] he's got too much power, too much strength and speed and size, so he's a very dangerous child."
samuel l. jackson as nick fury: the former director of s.h.i.e.l.d. who originally recruited the avengers and continues to be a mentor and leader for the team. jackson described the role as a cameo, saying the character didn't participate in the action scenes because "there's not a lot i could do except shoot a gun."thomas kretschmann and henry goodman reprise their roles as baron wolfgang von strucker and dr. list, hydra leaders who specialize in human experimentation, advanced robotics, and artificial intelligence from captain america: the winter soldier. linda cardellini portrays laura barton, hawkeye's wife; claudia kim portrays helen cho, a world-renowned geneticist who helps the avengers from her office in seoul; andy serkis portrays ulysses klaue, a south-african black-market arms dealer, smuggler and gangster who is a former acquaintance from stark's weapons-dealing days; and julie delpy appears as madame b., who mentored black widow into becoming an assassin. kerry condon voices the artificial intelligence f.r.i.d.a.y., a replacement for j.a.r.v.i.s., while spader also voices stark's iron legion droids. josh brolin makes an uncredited appearance during the mid-credits scene as thanos, reprising his role from guardians of the galaxy (2014). avengers co-creator stan lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as a military veteran who attends the avengers' victory party. tom hiddleston was to reprise his role of loki, but his scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film.


== production ==


=== development ===

in october 2011, kevin feige, president of marvel studios said the studio was beginning to look at their phase two films, which would start with iron man 3 and would culminate in a second avengers film. in march 2012, joss whedon, director of the first film, stated that he would want a sequel to be more small, personal, and painful; that does "not just a rehash of what seemed to work the first time", and a theme having full of originality to itself. despite the production of the film becoming increasingly wider in scope, feige maintained that this was not their intention, always looking to see where the team wanted to take the characters, over how to make it bigger than the avengers.at the premiere of the avengers, feige said the studio had an option for whedon to return as director. in may 2012, after the successful release of the first film, disney ceo bob iger announced a sequel was in development. most of the film's cast members were under contract to potentially appear in the sequel; however, robert downey jr. was not, as his four-picture deal with marvel expired after iron man 3.at the 2012 san diego comic-con international, whedon said he was undecided about directing. however, in august 2012, iger announced that whedon would return to write and direct the sequel and develop the marvel television series, agents of s.h.i.e.l.d., for abc. later in the month, disney set a may 1, 2015, release date. whedon said his return for a sequel "wasn't a tough decision"; he thought it was "not going to happen", but realized he "desperately wanted to say more about these characters" when he started considering it. whedon said that they intended for the film's production to not be as rushed as the first one.in december 2012, whedon stated that he had completed an outline for the film. in march 2013, whedon said that he looked to the empire strikes back (1980) and the godfather part ii (1974) as inspirations.feige revealed that captain marvel, who starred in her own mcu film in 2019, appeared in an early draft of the screenplay, but was removed since the character had not yet been cast, saying, "it didn't feel like the time. we didn't want to introduce her fully formed flying in a costume before you knew who she was or how she came to be." whedon went so far as to shoot visual effects plates for captain marvel to fly into avengers headquarters at the end of the film; those shots were reused; however, for scarlet witch instead. feige also revealed that an early draft of the script had hulk's quinjet detected near saturn at the end of the film, but it was finally decided to keep it earth-based and leave his fate ambiguous in order to dispel rumors that a film based on the "planet hulk" comic storyline was in development, which marvel studios had no plans to adapt at the time. marvel would later decide to adapt "planet hulk" for the film thor: ragnarok (2017), in which the hulk does end up leaving earth.


=== pre-production ===
by april 2013, filming was scheduled to begin in early 2014 at shepperton studios in england. at the hollywood premiere of iron man 3, whedon said that he had completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. whedon also mentioned that he wrote with downey in mind and included a "brother/sister act" from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to quicksilver and scarlet witch. whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film that "their powers are very visually interesting", with problems which whedon "had on the first one" for strong powers; those powers are superspeed, and spells and telekinesis, respectively, which "they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh," though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict, which do not like the united states and the avengers, and "the avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice." because marvel studios shared the film rights to quicksilver and scarlet witch with 20th century fox and had to avoid conflict with fox's x-men films, whedon introduced two important characters into the marvel cinematic universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, "it meant we could spend a little time inside the avengers' headseither their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above." by may, downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with marvel studios and reprise his role as iron man in the film. a month later, downey signed on to return for the then-untitled avengers sequel, as well as a third avengers film.

at the 2013 san diego comic-con international, whedon announced the film would be subtitled age of ultron. despite the subtitle, the film is not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries age of ultron. feige explained that they simply liked the title age of ultron but the plot was taken from decades of avengers story arcs. whedon added that ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that hank pym would not be involved with ultron's creation. whedon disclosed that edgar wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in ant-man, which was already in development. he also thought that ultron needed to be conceived through the avengers and since they already had tony stark and bruce banner on the team, it would not make sense to bring in a third scientist. whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to ultron's involvement.the title of the film came as a surprise to many fans who were expecting thanos, the mastermind behind the events of the first film, to be the main villain in the sequel, with whedon saying, "thanos was never meant to be the next villain. he's always been the overlord of villainy and darkness." commenting on finding the right balance between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in avengers: age of ultron, feige explained that iron man is a technology-based hero, and his films are always based on those; thor is a fantasy-based hero introduced in the 2011 film of the same name, which also introduces asgard, a fantastical realm in "the more reality-based mcu"; and finally, ultron is "clearly [...] come[s] out of technology," using tools that established in the franchise to construct age of ultron storyline.casting continued into august 2013, with the announcement that james spader would play ultron. in november, marvel confirmed that elizabeth olsen and aaron taylor-johnson would play the scarlet witch and quicksilver, respectively. taylor-johnson had been in negotiations since as early as june, while olsen's potential involvement was first reported in august. by the end of the year, mark ruffalo, chris evans, samuel l. jackson, chris hemsworth, scarlett johansson, jeremy renner, and cobie smulders were confirmed to be returning to their roles from the first film, and don cheadle, who portrayed james rhodes in the iron man films, had committed to a part in the film. in the early months of 2014, thomas kretschmann was cast as baron wolfgang von strucker, claudia kim was cast in an unspecified role, and paul bettany, who voiced j.a.r.v.i.s. in previous mcu films, was cast as the vision. whedon said "juggling" all the characters in the film was "a nightmare"; he explained: "they're very disparate characters. the joy of the avengers is they really don't belong in the same room. it's not like the x-men, who are all tortured by the same thing and have similar costumes. these guys are just all over the place. and so it's tough. honestly, this is as tough as anything i've ever done."on january 24, 2014, the forte di bard association announced that filming would take place at fort bard in the aosta valley region of italy in march 2014, as well as other locations in aosta valley including aosta, bard, donnas, pont-saint-martin, and verrs. the next month, the gauteng film commission announced that action sequences would be filmed in johannesburg, south africa, and other locations in gauteng, beginning in mid-february. a few weeks later marvel announced that portions of the film would be shot in south korea. feige cited the nation's "cutting-edge technology, beautiful landscapes and spectacular architecture" as ideal for the film. the nation's capital, seoul, and seoul's surrounding province, gyeonggi, were selected as filming locations, with south korea's ministry of culture, sports and tourism reimbursing up to 30% of the studio's expenditures, as part of a state-funded incentive program.


=== filming ===

filming began on tuesday, february 11, 2014, in johannesburg, south africa, having been postponed that monday. second unit crews shot action sequences without the main cast, to be used as background plates for scenes featuring the hulk, in the central business district of johannesburg for a period of two weeks. by mid-march, principal photography had begun at shepperton studios near london and was scheduled to film there for at least four months, under the working title after party. filming at shepperton as well as other locations in england allowed whedon to get a "number of different looks and textures and moods" to give the film a different palette and fresh aesthetic from its predecessor. production designer charles wood built an enormous, new avengers tower set, one of the largest sets ever built for a marvel film. the set featured multiple connected environments and levels. on march 22, production moved to fort bard, italy and continued in the aosta valley region through march 28. the region doubled as the fictional eastern european nation of sokovia, with crews replacing local storefronts with cyrillic script. filming in south korea began on march 30 on the mapo bridge, and continued through april 14 at various locations in seoul. while in seoul, the production was able to attach cameras to drones and race cars to get unique camera angles and footage. an artificial island on the han river known as the saebit dungdungseom served as the headquarters of an it institute featured in the film. scenes involving ultron's attack on parts of the city were shot in the gangnam district.in april, shooting began in hawley woods in hampshire, england, and hayley atwell, who played peggy carter in previous mcu films, filmed scenes inside the rivoli ballroom in london while extras performed the lindy hop. that june, scenes were shot at the university of east anglia in norwich and at dover castle in kent, with dover castle used for interior shots of strucker's hydra base in sokovia. the next month, filming took place at a training facility for london's metropolitan police service, which doubled as a city in sokovia. additional filming took place in chittagong, bangladesh, including the chittagong ship breaking yard, and in new york state. on august 6, whedon announced on twitter that he had completed principal photography on avengers: age of ultron. disney spent $330.6 million on avengers: age of ultron from february 2013 to november 2014, but $50.7 million of this was offset by payments from the uk tax authority. a report on actual production costs for films from filml.a. inc., indicated a gross budget of $444 million, with a net of $365 million for avengers: age of ultron. this makes the film the second most expensive film ever made.cinematographer ben davis, who also worked with marvel on guardians of the galaxy, shot the film with a main unit of three arri alexa cameras. davis said, "although the alexa was marvel's preferred camera, we weren't locked into that choice from the start. what wasn't negotiable was the fact that we were shooting digital: that's how marvel shoots all of its films." davis also used blackmagic design's pocket cinema cameras to meet the needs of the second unit kit explaining, "the second unit typically needs a fleet of smaller cameras that are less expensive and are rugged enough to handle the various trials by fire, as it were, that we throw at them." about the camera system, whedon stated that this film was shot very differently from the first one; using many long lenses, and that he aimed to shoot the film almost like a documentary. to create the scenes depicting how quicksilver views the world, scenes were shot with an ultra-high-speed camera and later combined with shots of taylor-johnson moving through the same scene at normal speed.


=== post-production ===

in june 2014, the imax corporation announced that the imax release of the film would be converted to imax 3d. following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including stellan skarsgrd, anthony mackie, idris elba, and tom hiddleston, reprising their roles from previous mcu films. however, hiddleston's scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film, with whedon saying what was shot "didn't play" and he did not want the film to feel "overstuffed". according to hiddleston, "in test screenings, audiences had overemphasized loki's role, so they thought that because i was in it, i was controlling ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations." whedon later explained that elba and atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the avengers from scarlet witch's power. in december 2014, kim's role was revealed as dr. helen cho. additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in january 2015 at pinewood studios. in february 2015, marvel confirmed through promotional material that serkis portrays ulysses klaue in the film. in early april 2015, linda cardellini and julie delpy were confirmed to be part of the film's cast. at the same time, whedon stated that the film would not contain a post-credits scene, which had become customary for mcu films. whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the "shawarma scene" in the avengers, explaining, "it didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right. the first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and do something else. don't do the indiana jones gun trick again differently. just go somewhere else. don't try to hit the same highs, because people will sense it." however, feige clarified, "there will be a tag [shortly after the credits start]. but there's not a postpostcredit scene."in may 2015, whedon revealed he was in conflict with marvel executives and the film's editors about certain scenes in the film. the executives were not "thrilled" with the scenes at hawkeye's farm or the dream sequences the avengers experience because of scarlet witch. also, whedon had originally shot a much longer scene with thor and selvig in the cave but the final version is shorter as test audiences did not respond well to the original cut. in the scene, thor would be possessed by a norn, a goddess of destiny, while selvig would quiz her about thor's hallucination. additionally, whedon reiterated he had wanted to include captain marvel and spider-man at the end, but deals for each character (signing of an actress and a deal with sony pictures entertainment, respectively) were not completed in time for their inclusion.the film contains 3,000 visual effects shots, completed by ten different visual effects studios, including industrial light & magic (ilm), trixter, double negative, animal logic, framestore, lola vfx, territory, perception, method studios, luma pictures, and the third floor. ilm opened a facility in london, citing avengers: age of ultron as a catalyst for the expansion, and developed a new motion capture system for the film called muse, which can better capture an actor's performance and combine different takes. about the motion capture process, ruffalo called it "more of a collaboration" since the technology is advancing, with "the face capture and the motion capture can now [being] put together, [allowing] you [to] get a lot more latitude as a performer [...] you're no longer constricted by the attributes that you have as a person: your age, or weight, or size. none of that matters anymore. and so there's this whole exciting place to go that is kind of unknown." visual effects supervisor christopher townsend said that the visual effects team considered depicting the hulk when manipulated by wanda maximoff as being grey skinned with red eyes, but eventually decided against it, as they did not want to confuse audiences who might associate it with "joe fixit", the grey hulk from the comics.method studios created the interior of the new avengers training facility by digitally designing the training facility, extracting the characters from the original set and placing them into the new cg environment. method also contributed to iron man's new mark 45 suit and played a key role in creating scarlet witch's cg mind control effect. following the trend in recent years, most of the computer screens in stark's lab, dr. cho's laboratory, the quinjet and other locations in the film were not added in post-production but were actually working screens on set, adding to the realism of the film and saving some on the post-production budget. london-based territory studio delivered the screen visuals filled with unique imagery and animations that matched the character using them. perception worked on the main-on-end and main titles for the film. before settling on the marble monument depiction for the main-on-end titles, perception created three other versions, which were based on ultron's hive mind ability from the film, "renderings of power and pure energy" inspired by classic comic panels, and classic moments for each character. the final design was inspired by war monuments such as the iwo jima memorial. for the main titles, marvel wanted the typeface to be a direct continuation of the first film. perception made the typeface a marble texture to mimic the main-on-end titles and changed the title's rotation (away from the camera instead of towards the camera in the avengers), before "age of ultron" overtakes "avengers" in a vibranium texture.


== music ==

in march 2014, brian tyler signed on to compose the film's score, replacing the composer for the first film, alan silvestri, while also marking his third film collaboration with marvel following iron man 3 and thor: the dark world in 2013. tyler stated that the score pays homage to john williams' scores for star wars (1977), superman (1978), and raiders of the lost ark (1981) and references the scores for the iron man, thor, and captain america films in order to create a similar musical universe, saying, "that's the goal for sure. you have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it." danny elfman also contributed music to the score, reprising silvestri's theme from the first film to create a new hybrid theme. hollywood records released the album digitally on april 28, 2015, and in physical formats on may 19.

the first trailer was scheduled to premiere during the airing of an episode of agents of s.h.i.e.l.d. on october 28, 2014. however, on october 22, the trailer leaked online, and within a few hours marvel officially released the trailer on youtube. entertainment weekly and the hollywood reporter noted the effective use of the song "i've got no strings" from pinocchio (1940) in the trailer. scott mendelson of forbes felt the trailer was "such a textbook 'dark sequel' trailer that it borders on parody" but said, "it's a pretty spectacular piece of marketing, one that elevates itself both by the music choices and by james spader's vocals as the title villain". the trailer received 34.3 million global views in 24 hours, 26.2 million from marvel's youtube channel, which broke the previous record held by iron man 3 with 23.14 million views. in comparison, the original avengers teaser received 20.4 million views in 24 hours after its debut. in response, marvel agreed to air footage from age of ultron during the episode of agents of s.h.i.e.l.d. that was originally scheduled to premiere the trailer. at the end of october, marvel comic's editor-in-chief axel alonso stated there were comic tie-in plans for the film.in november 2014, abc aired another one-hour television special titled marvel 75 years: from pulp to pop!, which featured behind the scenes footage of age of ultron. also in november, an extended trailer debuted on samsung mobile's youtube channel, featuring product placement for various samsung devices. in december 2014, additional behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the guardians of the galaxy blu-ray, highlighting the various filming locations for the film. that same month, abc announced that an episode of marvel's agents of s.h.i.e.l.d. would tie-in to the events of the film. the episodes "the frenemy of my enemy" and "the dirty half dozen" feature "easter eggs, plot threads and other connective tissue leading into the opening scene of avengers: age of ultron" while "scars" explores the aftermath of the film.in january 2015, a featurette focusing on ultron was shown at samsung's "night with marvel" event at the 2015 consumer electronics show (ces). also at ces, samsung revealed a selection of hardware inspired by the avengers films, as well as a simulation of avengers tower via its gear vr virtual reality device. a second trailer premiered on espn on january 12, 2015 during the broadcast of the 2015 college football playoff national championship. mendelson enjoyed the trailer, but wished it did not reveal as many story elements as it did. however, he added, "the marketing thus far [for the film] has been far superior to much of what sold the avengers three years ago, both in terms of the specific footage and the artistic choices being made [...] i'm sold, and i imagine most of the general moviegoers are already onboard too."on february 3, 2014, marvel "stealth released" a one-shot digital-only tie-in comic, avengers: age of ultron preludethis scepter'd isle. written by will corona pilgrim and illustrated by wellinton alves, it reveals how strucker came into possession of loki's scepter and the origin of the maximoff twins' abilities. at the end of the month, the film's official poster was revealed. graeme mcmillan of the hollywood reporter criticized it for its lack of originality, calling it "pretty much the poster for the first avengers movie, except with added flying robots in the background" and the fact that it incorporated many of the same tropes the other mcu phase two film posters did. these included the hero(es) staring off camera; destruction in the background as well as something occurring in the sky; and poor photoshop on the poster, highlighting the fact that each of the actors were obviously photographed separately and were later composited together into the poster. mendelson agreed with many of mcmillan's observations, and called the poster "hilariously photoshopped".the final trailer was "unlocked" by fans on march 4, 2015, via the use of hashtags on twitter, ahead of its broadcast debut during the series premiere of american crime on march 5. mendelson felt "this [was] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know" adding, "here we have the fourth and final avengers: age of ultron trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. i have expressed my concern dating back to october that marvel and disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between october and may. but if this really is the final avengers 2 trailer, then at least on the trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled." a week after the final trailer debuted, marvel revealed that the trailer had "smashed records" with over 35 million views.in april 2015, members of the cast presented downey with the mtv generation award at the 2015 mtv movie awards, along with debuting an exclusive clip from the film. on april 27, downey and renner along with executives from marvel entertainment rang the opening bell of the new york stock exchange in celebration of the film's theatrical release. disney spent a total of $26.9 million on television advertisements for the film, from an estimated total marketing budget of $180 million.

=== critical response ===
the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reported an approval rating of 76% with an average score of 6.8/10 based on 370 reviews. the website's critical consensus reads, "exuberant and eye-popping, avengers: age of ultron serves as an overstuffed but mostly satisfying sequel, reuniting its predecessor's unwieldy cast with a few new additions and a worthy foe." metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100 based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "a" on an a+ to f scale, and those at posttrak gave the film a 90% overall positive score and a 79% recommend.todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter said, "avengers: age of ultron succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, but this time the action scenes don't always measure up." scott foundas of variety wrote, "if this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015, we could be doing much worse. unlike its title character, age of ultron most definitely has soul." writing for the chicago sun-times and giving the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, richard roeper said, "some day, an avengers film might collapse under the weight of its own awesomeness. i mean, how many times can they save the world? but this is not that day." peter travers of rolling stone wrote, "age of ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie. it doesn't just go to 11, it starts there. [joss whedon] takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. but he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic in every sense of the word." matt zoller seitz of rogerebert.com gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite being "bigger, louder, and more disjointed" than its predecessor, "it's also got more personalityspecifically whedon'sthan any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise." helen o'hara of empire praised the interactions between the characters, the action set-pieces and whedon's ability as a director in her review, stating that the film "redefines the scale we can expect from our superheroes."conversely, kenneth turan of the los angeles times said, "although this movie is effective moment to moment, very little of it lingers in the mind afterward. the ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification, it disappears without a trace almost as soon as it's consumed." scott mendelson of forbes said, "avengers: age of ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do." manohla dargis of the new york times wrote, "this avengers doesn't always pop the way that the first one sometimes did, partly because its villain isn't as memorable, despite mr. spader's silky threat." camilla long of the sunday times remarked, "two hours of boredom and boobs add up to a sorry basis for the new avengers." much like the release of guardians of the galaxy, the film received mixed reviews upon release in china, due to poor translations. the translations, which were said to be too literal, were thought "to have been done by google translate."
