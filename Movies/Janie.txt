== reception ==
bosley crowther, critic for the new york times, panned the film, writing, "the authors of 'janie', play and picture, have simply cut a theatrical farce with some kids. and the bluntness with which they have done so provides very little warm appeal"; and: "the performance of joyce reynolds in the title role is completely surface and pretentious; she had nothing with which to work".the film was followed two years later by a sequel, janie gets married.
