== plot ==
fisherman matt boyd is fishing in lake victoria when a small earthquake hits, splitting the lake floor and causing a whirlpool. boyd falls in and is ripped apart by a school of piranhas that emerge from the chasm.
as spring break begins, jake forester reunites with his old crush kelly and meets her arrogant boyfriend, todd dupree. jake meets derrick jones, a sleazy pornographer as well as danni, one of his actresses. derrick convinces jake to show him good spots on the lake for filming a pornographic movie. jake's mother, sheriff julie forester, searches for the missing matt boyd with deputy fallon. they find his mutilated body and contemplate closing the lake. however, this decision is made difficult with thousands of partying college students on spring break, which is important for bringing revenue to the small town. the next morning, a lone cliff diver is attacked and consumed by the vicious piranhas.
jake's siblings zane and laura take a canoe to go fishing on a small sandbar island and become stranded in the middle of the lake due to zane neglecting to properly secure the canoe. jake runs into kelly, who accepted derrick's invitation on board his boat, and meets derrick's other actress crystal and his cameraman andrew.
julie takes a team of seismologist divers: novak, sam, and paula to the fissure. novak speculates that the rift leads to a buried prehistoric lake. paula and sam scuba dive to the bottom and discover a big cavern filled with large piranha egg stocks. both are killed by the piranhas before they can alert the others. novak and julie find paula's corpse and pull it onto the boat, capturing a lone piranha, which they take to carl goodman, a retired marine biologist. he explains that it is a highly aggressive prehistoric species known as pygocentrus nattereri, or the original piranha, long believed to have been extinct for over 2 million years and that the piranhas have survived through cannibalism. the species is able to vigorously devour its prey in seconds.
julie, novak, fallon and deputy taylor roberts try to evacuate the lake but their warnings are ignored until the piranhas begin to attack the tourists, turning the party into a bloodbath. novak boards a jet-ski with a shotgun to help while the rest of the team try to save the others. almost everyone in the lake is either wounded, dismembered, or killed by the piranhas, including todd.
meanwhile, jake spots laura and zane on the island and forces derrick to rescue them. derrick crashes the boat, flooding the lower deck and causing the boat to begin sinking. kelly is trapped in the kitchen while derrick, crystal and andrew fall overboard. andrew escapes to shore alive, crystal is eaten, and danni manages to get a partially-eaten derrick back on board, where he eventually dies.
deputy fallon makes a last stand, taking a boat motor and using its propeller to shred many piranhas, though he is presumably killed by them. julie and novak reach jake on a speedboat and attach a rope to his boat. julie, danni, laura and zane start crossing the rope but the piranhas latch onto danni's hair, causing her to fall and be devoured. the others make it across safely but the rope comes loose. jake ties the line to himself and goes to save kelly. he ties her to him and lights a flare after releasing the gas from stored propane tanks. novak speeds the boat away just as the piranhas surround kelly and jake. they are dragged to safety as the propane tanks explode, killing most of the piranhas.
mr. goodman calls julie, who tells him that they seem to have killed the majority of the piranhas. goodman tells her that the reproductive glands on the piranha they obtained were not mature, which means the fish they have killed were only the babies. as novak wonders aloud where the mature ones are, a human-sized piranha leaps out of the water and eats him.


== cast ==

richard dreyfuss said that he accepted the role after bob weinstein persuaded him by offering him a larger salary, which dreyfuss later donated to charity. dreyfuss also stated that the ill-fated character he plays is a parody and a near-reincarnation of matt hooper, the character he portrayed in the film jaws (1975), with whom his character shares the same first name. jaws was the inspiration for the first movie in the "piranha" film series, 1978's piranha.   the song the character in piranha 3d listens to on the radio on his boat is "show me the way to go home", which richard dreyfuss, roy scheider and robert shaw sing together aboard quint's boat the orca in jaws.
eli roth, ashlynn brooke, bonnie morgan, genevieve alexandra and gianna michaels appear as spring breakers who meet gruesome demises, while franck khalfoun and jason spisak portray deputies.


== production ==
chuck russell was originally scheduled to direct the film, and made uncredited rewrites to the script by josh stolberg and peter goldfinger, as well as incorporating the original john sayles script that joe dante directed the first time around. alexandre aja was selected to direct the film instead.production on the film was scheduled to begin late 2008, but was delayed until march 2009. in october 2008, aja stated filming would begin in the spring. he further stated "it's such a difficult movie, not only because of the technicality of it and the cgi fish, but also because it all happens in a lake. we were supposed to start shooting now, but the longer to leave it the colder the water gets. the movie takes place during spring break and, of course, the studio wanted it ready for the summer, but if you've got 1,000 people who need to get murdered in the water, you have to wait for the right temperature for the water, for the weather, for everything."shooting took place in june 2009 at bridgewater channel in lake havasu, located in lake havasu city, arizona. the water was also dyed red for the shooting.citing constraints with 3d camera rigs, aja shot piranha in 2d and converted to 3d in post production using a 3d conversion process developed by michael roderick and used by the company, inner-d. unlike some other 3d converted films released in 2010, piranha's conversion was not done as an afterthought, and it was one of the first post-conversion processes to be well received by critics.
