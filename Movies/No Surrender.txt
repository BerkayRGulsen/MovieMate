critical reception for the film has been mixed. the stranger criticized it, saying that although it "makes the most of its tiny budget" it was ultimately "inarticulate and immature". the philadelphia city paper wrote that it was "not without its flaws" but was ultimately "a bold, ballsy and attention-getting debut". total film panned it, giving the dvd release two stars and calling it a "yawn fest". james berardinelli gave it three and a half stars, praising dinovis's performance. the av club called it "memorable, but...also grubby, harsh, and lacking in wit". variety wrote that it was "disturbing, hard-edged tale of physical abuse and sexual aberration that pulls no punches" but that it was ultimately "decidedly for niche tastes".  roger ebert selected it for his first overlooked film festival in 1999.
