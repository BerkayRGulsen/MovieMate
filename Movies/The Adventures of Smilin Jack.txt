the adventures of smilin' jack is an aviation comic strip that first appeared october 1, 1933, in the chicago tribune and ended april 1, 1973.after a run of 40 years, it was the longest-running aviation comic strip. the strip was created by 27-year-old cartoonist and aviation enthusiast zack mosley, who had previously worked on the buck rogers and skyroads strips. mosley was a member of organizations that indicate his avid aviation research for his strip: aircraft owners and pilots association, aviation-space writers association, national cartoonists society, b.p.o. elks, silver wings society, ox-5 club, and the quiet birdmen fraternity for many years. on september 18, 1976, he was inducted into the civil air patrol auxiliary-usaf hall of honor.smilin' jack was originally mack martin, in on the wing, but chicago tribune editor joseph medill patterson did not like the original title, so on december 31, 1933, the name was changed to jack martin, and the strip was retitled the adventures of smilin' jack after its creator, who had been nicknamed "smilin' zack" by his colleagues. in later years it was simply known as smilin' jack. zack mosley's assistant during the 1930s and early 1940s was boody rogers. smilin' jack's appearance was based on that of notable air racing star roscoe turner.the sunday page had a topper strip, originally called air facts. this later became smilin' jack cut-outs, a paper doll feature, and then smilin' jack's flyin' facts.


== characters and story ==

smilin' jack developed an extremely colorful and imaginative band of supporting characters through its lengthy run, including the handsome downwind jaxon; fat stuff, a humorous hawaiian character; hillbilly mechanic rufus jimpson; glamorous air hostess dixie lee; and eventually jack jr., plus various romantic interests, referred to by mosley as "de-icers". villains included the claw, toemain the terrible, the head and his sister, the mongoose.
many supporting characters were drawn with distinctive visual devices. the corpulent fat stuff had buttons popping off his tight-fitting shirt, never explaining how the buttons magically regenerated from one panel to the next. mosley sometimes drew a chicken in one corner of the panel, eating buttons as they flew off.even more distinctive was smilin' jack's handsome sidekick and co-pilot downwind, whose face drove women wild with passion. downwind's features remain a mystery; he was invariably drawn with his head in three-quarters rear view so that his face was averted from the reader. this visual device sometimes became contrived, as when a villain stood in front of downwind aiming a weapon at him: the co-pilot would still be looking back over his shoulder, as if something more interesting was happening behind him.
