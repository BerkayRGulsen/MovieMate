=== critical reception ===
everything about her received generally positive reviews from film critics, praising the three main actors' performances.
oggs cruz from rappler gave a positive review saying "everything about her is predictable, which isn't necessary a problem. there is also something inherently wrong about the message of women being forced to choose between motherhood and their careers, but that message is but part and parcel of the studio's family-friendly and escapist agendas."rod magaru show, a blogger gave a rating of 9/10 saying that "the film's attempt to bring out the tears in audience eyes succeeded in multiple scenes. if you have to ask me, i will never ever let my mom feel like i am near yet so far. but of course we live in different background. from professional writers' perspective, there's a story behind everything. how a picture got on a wall. how a scar got on your face."
