== plot ==
in the film, lillian travers, a wealthy northern woman about to be married, visits her aunt in florida. while there, she stops in a curiosity shop and buys a small casket which contains a note and a vial of seeds. at her aunt's house she reads the note which explains that the seeds change men into women and vice versa. angry with her fianc, fred, lillian decides to test the effects of the seeds. the next morning, lillian discovers that she has transformed into a man. lillian's transformation into lawrence talbot has also sometimes been read as a transformation into a butch lesbian. this reading is bolstered by the later transformation of lillian's fianc into what could be an effeminate gay man. however, as lillian and her fianc are shown attracted both to each other and to the same sex (albeit at different times), the film has also been considered to have the first documented appearance of bisexual characters in an american motion picture.
