purnima sriram iyer of the new indian express termed nene raju nene mantri a "riveting political drama"; iyer found the narration "gripping and enthralling" and the dialogues "hard-hitting". she added that teja writing was effective enough to let even a politically-ignorant person "enlightened about the subject". hemanth kumar, writing for firstpost, called nene raju nene mantri the "cinematic equivalent of newton's third law of physics" where "every action is met with an equal and opposite reaction". kumar noted that the leads' performances and teja's writing are the film's strengths, adding that aggarwal's portrayal of radha was the "biggest revelation". karthik kumar of hindustan times noted that the entire film is built on the bonding between the lead characters, with the political backdrop used only "to give the story a solid padding". kumar was appreciative of daggubati's performance: "[his] powerful screen presence takes everything up a notch and it's a treat to watch him turn from good to grey." suresh kavirayani of deccan chronicle praised the performances and the portrayal of emotions such as love, hatred, smartness and cruelty handled by jogendra. he, however, felt that the second half suffered from an "overdose of sentiment".writing for the hindu, sangeetha devi dundoo opined that the film's later segments lacked the sharpness of the initial moments. she termed jogendra as one of the "most intriguing characters rana [daggubati] has played" and found its actions troubling the narrative. neeshita nyayapati, reviewing for the times of india, found nene raju nene mantri a good love story of radha and jogendra than an effective political drama; she stated that the political angle "seems like a pesky annoyance in an otherwise beautiful movie". nyayapati was also critical of rani's characterisation, calling it a "messy" one with "no thought put into it at all". sify noted that the film turns "tedious and predictable" post intermission and criticised the script's lack of logic in the later portions. the reviewer added that daggubati's portrayal of jogendra was a "stunning act" and "very intense" in crucial scenes.criticising the lack of cohesiveness, nagarjuna rao of gulf news added that the addition of few irrelevant characters and implausible situations in the later portions "drain the viewer much before the climax, which turns out to be a denouement". rao also found rubens' score "too loud, to the point of being irritating". manoj kumar r, writing for the indian express, was critical of teja's direction. he found the climax "cringe worthy" because of teja's attempt to "underplay the gravity of crimes jogendra committed". he also added that teja's reservations failed to give rana's character a logical conclusion. k. naresh kumar of the hans india found the film a "patchy effort" and criticised its indifferent treatment: "building up the hero as a crusader for the common man, despite his questionable and violent tactics in retaining his political status is the main contradiction that one feels, the film suffers from." sowmya rajendran of the news minute opined that the narrative "simply does not hold together" and found the cgi "patchy". rajendran too felt that the film doesn't allow jogendra's devolution "to really punch [the viewers] in the gut, because it wants to simultaneously hail him as a hero."
