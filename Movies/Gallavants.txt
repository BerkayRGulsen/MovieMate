== plot ==
galavant is a dashing knight, down on his luck, determined to reclaim his reputation and his "happily ever after" by going after the evil king richard, who ruined it the moment he kidnapped the love of galavant's life, madalena. galavant is assisted by his squire, sid, and the lovely princess isabella, whose kingdom of valencia has been conquered by richard. meanwhile, the malevolent but weak-willed richard tries to win over the scheming madalena and seeks help from his brawny henchman, gareth, and his chef, vincenzo. the episodes chronicle galavant's journeys (and the twists and turns that go along with them) through musical numbers composed and written by menken and slater. they participate in a joust, visit sid's hometown, are captured by pirates, and make a stop with a band of singing monks before finally being captured by richard and gareth as they try to infiltrate the castle to rescue madalena, who, it turns out, doesn't want or need to be rescued. richard is knocked off the throne when his older brother shows up and claims it, and everyone finds themselves locked in the dungeon together. richard's brother orders the captives executed. gareth refuses and sets them all free but sid, but before the new king can retaliate he is stabbed in the back and madalena puts gareth on the throne of valencia beside her. isabella and crew seek shelter with her cousin harry in hortensia, where she is locked away until they can marry, and richard and galavant (who, it turns out, is more than a little fickle) set sail with the pirates to rescue her. 
in the second season, richard attempts to find a new role for himself in life, and he falls in love with roberta steinglass, a childhood friend. galavant goes to great lengths to recruit an army to help him on his quest.  richard also adopts a lizard, believing it will grow into a dragon and draws a sword that he does not know can only be drawn by the "one true king to unite them all." at the same time, chester wormwood, an evil sorcerer who doubles as a wedding planner, has taken control of isabella's mind so she is now accepting being married to her cousin.  when his plan eventually backfires, isabella exiles him, and he flees to valencia, where he encourages gareth and madalena to start an unplanned war with hortensia.  wormwood also offers to teach them his "dark dark evil way" (abbreviated as d'dew) of sorcery, which gareth rejects but madalena secretly accepts. all the episodes of the season lead up to the finale, a huge battle between three armies, including the valencians, the hortensians, and a swarm of zombies led by galavant and richard.

=== critical reception ===
the first season averaged 4.83 million live viewers, and 6.52 million including dvr-playback. it has received generally positive reviews: rotten tomatoes gives it a rating of 90%, based on reviews from 36 critics, with an average rating of 7.5/10. the site's critical consensus reads, "while the jokes in galavant ride the line of predictability, their execution, along with campy themes and silly musical numbers, make it memorably entertaining." on metacritic, it has a score of 61 out of 100, based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".the new york times' neil genzlinger gave it a mixed response saying, "despite some amusing bits and clever songs, it's only occasionally as much fun as it ought to be." brian lowry of variety gave it a mostly positive review saying, "owing a strong debt to monty python and a lesser one to spoofs like when things were rotten, galavant largely overcomes the challenges that have traditionally bedeviled tv musicals with rambunctious energy, cheeky lyrics and music, and  significantly  a half-hour format, thus condensing the need to create songs into a manageable task."tv line's matt webb mitovich wrote, "with some resignation, given a colleague's 'meh' reaction to the pilot, i finally cued up galavant and found myself binge-watching the six episodes available to me. (and i seldom binge anything.) that's why i think abc is smart to double-pump episodes, because yes, the plot progression is a bit slow, pausing as it does to allow for song-and-dance numbers and vamping by the more colorful characters (the king included). you'll want two at a time to come away satisfied." alan sepinwall of hitfix, however, was more negative, writing, "...the whole is less than the sum of its comic and musical parts."the second season was met with equally positive critical response: on rotten tomatoes, it has a 100% rating, based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. the consensus reads: "the surprise second season of galavant sends its cast in many directions, but keeps the fun and music that made it a hit firmly at its center."  on metacritic, it has a 77/100 rating based on 4 critics.
