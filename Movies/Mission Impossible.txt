=== change to theme music ===
the television version is in a rarely used 54 time (an unusual time signature with five crotchets to a bar) and is difficult to dance to, as was proven by a memorable segment of american bandstand in which teenage dancers were caught off-guard by dick clark's playing of the lalo schifrin single release.
the opening theme music for the first six films are stylized renditions of schifrin's original iconic theme, preserving the 54 rhythm, by danny elfman, hans zimmer, michael giacchino, joe kraemer and lorne balfe, respectively. most of the versions included in the score also retained the 54 time signature.however, for adam clayton and larry mullen, jr.'s version featured on the first film's motion picture soundtrack, the time signature was changed to standard pop 44 time to make it more dance-friendly, although the intro is still in 54 time. the limp bizkit song "take a look around" from the soundtrack to the second film was set to a similar 44 modification of the theme, with an interlude in 54.
