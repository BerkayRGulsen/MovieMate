meanwhile, in a long-standing bloody feud, two factions of a political party have been laying claim to a wall on which they can paint the portraits of their respective political leaders. anbu, under the local leader of one of the parties, maari (charles vinoth), is determined to claim that wall for their own party. the other party chief is kannan (poster nandakumar), and along with his son perumal (mime gopi), they are hell bent in making sure that their opponents' efforts go in vain. the painting of kannan's father krishnappan's (v. i. s. jayapalan) face has been on the wall for two decades, since the start of the feud. the two parties and their supporters get into frequent clashes and scrapes. in the meantime, kaali falls in love with a politician's daughter kalaiarasi (catherine tresa), but she remains cold with him.
in a spur of motivation due to the upcoming elections, anbu reserves the wall for their party. although the wall is in their area and technically theirs, the opposition asks anbu to give it up as the portrait of their patriarch had been there for quite some time. moreover, since three deaths had previously taken place in connection to the wall, along with the deaths of members from both parties, people have started to consider the wall as a bad omen. anbu, however, declines. and when a goon of kannan's starts insulting anbu, kaali attacks him, leading to kannan seeing anbu as the reason for maari's resurgence. kannan's henchmen plan to kill anbu and kaali.
in the meantime, kalaiarasi professes her love to kaali. when the henchmen try to kill kaali and anbu, they escape and hide behind a van. they see perumal, who does not notice them, talking on a phone, giving orders to kill anbu at any cost. kaali then kills perumal with a straight hit to head using a crowbar. anbu and kaali are told by maari to surrender at kanchipuram district court to avoid being killed by the henchmen. however, the fir contains anbu's name but not kaali's. anbu takes responsibility of the murder, despite kaali being against it, and hopes to be released soon.
however, just outside the court, kannan's henchmen hack anbu to death and seriously wound kaali. kaali slides into depression by guilt and swears revenge, attempting to kill kannan. afterwards he is berated for his short temper by his parents (rama and jaya rao) and maari, who want him to get his life back together. maari assures kaali, anbu's death will be avenged. kalairasi begins to comfort kaali, and they spend a lot of time together. one night however, as they are talking, kaali can't stop thinking about avenging anbu, and when questioned, says he loves anbu more than kalaiarasi, causing them to separate. kaali slides into further angst, but then makes up with kalaiarasi and they are married.
one day when kaali and kalaiarasi are at a restaurant, kaali notices one of maari's henchmen sitting at the next table. when he goes up to the henchman to talk, the latter runs away in fear. after kaali catches him, he learns maari has joined hands with the opposing party to become mla of rk nagar and that it was he who had anbu assassinated. kalaiarasi, though reluctant to let kaali pursue his revenge, lets him go. at a local meeting where maari is being felicitated, kaali spills the beans and the locals chase maari out. in a final act, kaali splashes paint on the wall, thus ruining the portrait. soon, everyone follows suit. maari plots to kill kaali but is betrayed by the touted successor of the opposing party when he tries to do so. kaali, in a final fight sequence, subdues the henchmen sent to kill him and grievously injures maari, who is soon killed.
kaali and kalaiarasi start teaching about in the building whose wall was the cause of this bloody feud. the wall now has a theme of children's education painted on it. however, kannan still wants to have his father's portrait on the wall.
