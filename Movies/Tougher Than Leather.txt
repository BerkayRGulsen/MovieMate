== background ==
the platinum-selling album, a follow-up to the group's big commercial breakthrough album 1986's raising hell, featured some of the group's classics like "run's house", "beats to the rhyme", and a cover of the monkees's "mary, mary". tougher than leather was the group's fourth effort and blended in elements of not only rap but also rock n' roll and funk, making it their most varied effort to date alongside king of rock.  "papa crazy" is based on "papa was a rollin' stone" by the temptations. the album was recorded at 5 studios in new york city: chung king house of metal, unique recording studios, inc., electric lady studios, ian london studios, greene st. recording.
in response to albums such as eric b. & rakim's paid in full, public enemy's it takes a nation of millions to hold us back, and boogie down productions' criminal minded and by all means necessary, the group made a distinct departure from their earlier work, as jam-master jay used a heavier amount of sampling.run and dmc also made changes in their rapping style (heavily influenced by rakim) as techniques such as alliteration, polysyllabic rhyming, and internal rhyme are found in songs like "i'm not going out like that," "radio station", and the title track. the group also introduces storytelling to their arsenal in "ragtime". despite this, run-d.m.c. does not abandon their formula of combining hip-hop beats with hard rock guitar riffs, using it in "miss elaine", the title track, "soul to rock and roll", and "mary, mary".
