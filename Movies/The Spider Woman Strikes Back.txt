the film was announced in march 1945. it was to be the first in a series starring the spider woman, like the ones universal had for dracula and frankenstein. it was the second time universal had spun off a horror series from their sherlock holmes movies, the first being the creeper from the pearl of death. the film was originally called the spider woman strikes again and was based on an original story by eric taylor. ford beebe was the original director attached.in september universal announced the film would be directed by arthur lubin. lubin said he "hated" the movie and did not want to do it but the studio threatened to put him on suspension otherwise. the lead roles went to sondegaard, brenda joyce, kirby grant and rondo hatton.


== reception ==
diabolique magazine said the film was "poorly received and helped kill off universals second horror cycle. and its a poor movie  a confused script and inadequate casting of support roles are mostly to blame but, it must be admitted, lubin did not seem to have a particular feel/affinity for horror material. he was probably too upbeat and happy a person  no james whale gloominess for him."
