== production ==
in february 1989 jerzy domaradzki was working with writer trevor farrant on another script when farrant gave him the screenplay for struck by lightning. the director loved it, terry charatsis applied for funding to the film finance corporation and managed to get the film up. it was shot in november 1989 in adelaide.


== reception ==
critics' reception was generally positive to glowing ("charming and exhilarating black comedy, marvellously acted by the whole cast."), but the australian audience stayed away, perhaps deterred by its "improving" nature, and abetted by low-key promotion and hesitant distribution. it has been played on free-to-air tv a few times.
there was a limited vhs, but to date no dvd, release.
