the times of india gave 3 out of 5 stars stating "suffices to say that yuddham sharanam and marimuthu impress with the emotional part but falter with the action drama. all said and done, this one might go down as naga chaitanyas best action-film to date".firstpost gave 2.75 out of 5 stars stating "at a runtime of 140 minutes, yuddham sharanam tries to weave a convincing tale of revenge and love. theres a lot to like about it, but then, at the same time, the film doesnt let you immerse yourself in its world. and this distance just keeps growing as we flip through its pages".behindwoods gave 2.75 out of 5 stars stating "a well-made film thats high on emotion and action".indiaglitz gave 2.25 out of 5 stars stating "a film whose plot never seems to thicken, a climax which disappears without a whimper, simplistic scenes, lack of twists.  without 'sharanam'".
