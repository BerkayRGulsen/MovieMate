musician aurelius rex and his wife delia, a retired singer, are the recipients of a wedding anniversary party in london thrown by a wealthy music promoter, rod hamilton. johnny cousin, a drummer with aspirations of starting his own band, promises to persuade delia to come out of retirement and resume performing, having been told that this is the only way his band will be backed. told in no uncertain terms that delia doesn't intend to resume her career, johnny begins a series of machinations at the party designed to make rex believe that delia has been having an affair with cass, the band's manager. he even alters a tape recording to distort the meaning of delia's private conversation. johnny's back-stabbing costs cass his job. delia's performance of a song, rehearsed solely for the party, furthers rex's suspicions that she is unhappy at home. rex assaults delia and makes public accusations about her infidelity. in the ensuing conversations, everyone, including johnny's neglected wife emily, eventually realises that johnny has fabricated the entire story. it is implied that delia and rex resume their relationship.
