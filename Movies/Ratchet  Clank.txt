qwark, jealous of ratchet and clank's acclaim, is offered to boost his image by drek, which the rangers captain accepts so long as drek never harms the rangers. drek has him disable the rangers' weapons during an assault on their laser-equipped planet destroyer, the deplanetizer. drek's lieutenant victor von ion boards the rangers' flagship and attacks clank, who subdues him by rusting him solid using a rainstorm-producing weapon. after drek breaks apart novalis, drek's chief scientist, doctor nefarious, then appears out of nowhere and ejects him to new quartu in an escape pod. he takes control of the deplanetizer, intending to end the galaxy in revenge for qwark's mistreatment when the scientist was a ranger. his plan is to demolish the planet umbris, which has a highly unstable core that would annihilate all other planets were it destroyed.
the rangers attack the deplanetizer again, but qwark intercepts and battles ratchet and clank. ratchet pleads with qwark to stop, causing qwark to realize he has been used, and the three confront nefarious. nefarious fires the laser, but the rangers move it off target from umbris and toward new quartu, killing drek too. nefarious tries to disintegrate qwark, but is stopped short by ratchet, causing nefarious himself to be disintegrated as he falls into the deplanetizer's laser chamber. ratchet, clank, and qwark manage to escape through a teleporter as the deplanitizer falls towards umbris. with nefarious thwarted, the rangers return to kerwan, and qwark is demoted to private. ratchet and clank reunite on veldin with ratchet promising to rejoin the rangers if he is needed. in a mid-credits scene, nefarious is alive and well and swears revenge on ratchet and clank for defeating him.
