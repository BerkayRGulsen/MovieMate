although the book was successful, a proposed film version was rejected by the british board of film censors (bbfc) in 1936 as it was a "very sordid story in very sordid surroundings". however, in 1940 the bbfc approved a similar proposal, with the film finally released in june 1941.in a contemporary review, the monthly film bulletin wrote, "here is a film that ranks with the best we have ever produced. the direction is excellent, the photography admirable, and the casting particularly good."
