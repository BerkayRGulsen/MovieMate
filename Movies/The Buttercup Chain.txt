== reception ==
vincent canby of the new york times wrote: "(director) miller and his screen writer, peter draper, avoided any revealing psychological confrontations in favor of making one of those depressingly modish movies in which the sensations created by things like slick photography, beautiful nudes and intrusive soundtrack music become the substance of the film, instead of its context."
