meanwhile, joe's ex-girlfriend inspector shantipriya phadnis (soha ali khan) is chasing an international criminal carlos (jaaved jaffrey) a lollypop-sucking international terrorist who is in town with a big murder plot. a local underworld don mk (vijay raaz) has been roped in to help carlos but with intentions of killing him.
