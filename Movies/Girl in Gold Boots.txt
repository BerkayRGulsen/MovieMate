== appearance on mst3k ==
girl in gold boots was obscure for many years after its release, until it featured as a season 10 episode of mystery science theater 3000. apparent skips in the print used in the television program led to some amusing continuity problems, including a scene in a diner in which buz suddenly appears in his seat next to michele and critter as if he teleports in during their conversation.
one dvd release (from mmi image entertainment, using a print from geneni film distributing company), shows the scene without the unintentional "teleport" skip but has its own continuity breaks, suggesting two different prints of the original film were used.


== soundtrack ==
nearly half of the songs in this music-laden movie, including the title song, were written by singer-songwriter and sound engineer chris howard, who appears as himself and is backed by a band called "the third world" in the credits (not to be confused with the reggae band third world). one scene features bongo player preston epps, who had achieved some fame a decade earlier with his 1959 pop hit, "bongo rock". in fact, epps is listed in the opening credits as "that bongo rock man."
