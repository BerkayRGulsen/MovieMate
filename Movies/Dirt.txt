dirt is a chinese film from 1994 which depicts the nascent rock music scene of beijing. it is considered an important example of the sixth generation movement that emerged in china after the tiananmen square protests of 1989.while the film's general pessimism about youth is shared by many other sixth generation films, a character's choice to have a child rather than an abortion has been seen by some scholars to have played a role in why the film received official permission to screen abroad, in contrast to the similarly themed beijing bastards.


== background ==
dirt was filmed on a shoestring budget and was funded primarily by lead actress, kong lin. dirt is often compared with another major sixth generation film about the beijing rock scene, zhang yuan's beijing bastards. in contrast to that film's underground status, however, guan hu paid nearly us$2000 for state studio affiliation, allowing the film to be distributed in china and screened abroad with approval from state regulators.
