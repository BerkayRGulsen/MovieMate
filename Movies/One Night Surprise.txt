=== critical reception ===
this film received positive reviews. the los angeles times wrote that "though jin set one night surprise in beijing, it's a sexy, cosmopolitan tale whose bilingual characters could just as easily be going to clubs with pole dancers and driving their mercedes-benzes in seoul, paris or l.a." variety said this film was a "remixing ideas from dude-centric hollywood laffers like the hangover and knocked up, but retooled for chinas distaff demographic, this date movie is at once sweetly whimsical and full of ballsy sexual wisecracks. sleek filmmaking, dollhouse visuals and fans international profile could parlay the pic into niche release overseas" and "the films lightly comic tone also conceals a fair measure of insight into the social stigma facing single career women in their 30s (nicknamed "leftover women" in china)".
