total film's paul bradshaw wrote, "with just four actors, a single setting and more twists than a bag full of pretzels, john langridges grimy lo-fi debut is almost smart, taut and nasty enough to bid for the tarantino comparisons hes obviously after." the evening standard's derek malcolm found the film "over-ambitious", starting "as an offbeat thriller with pseudo-pinterish dialogue" and ending up "much like a horror movie."writing in the guardian mark kermode praised the film, acknowledging that "john langridge's tortuously twisted warehouse-bound tale of a cuckolded husband seeking vengeance on his wife's lover does at least attempt to get the very most out of very little", while the independent wrote that the script "meditates on male insecurity and possessiveness", acknowledging however that "the attempt at menace unwisely borrows quotations from hollywood movies, [a fact] that make [the movie] sound rather wannabe in consequence.time out's tom huddleston wrote that "the cast make the best" of a script that is "as uninspired as the plot, all muttered threats, cockernee slang and an initially amusing, increasingly wearying overuse of the f-word."
