== critical reception ==
stephen holden of the new york times gave it a mixed to negative review:

the humor is both too oblique and too mild-mannered for the movie to cohere as a modern comic fable. it amounts to little more than a series of loosely connected tangents that come to an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion.
