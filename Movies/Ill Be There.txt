== early life and family ==
james todd smith was born on january 14, 1968 in bay shore, new york to ondrea griffith (born january 19, 1946) and james louis smith jr, also known as james nunya. according to the chicago tribune, "[as] a kid growing up middle class and catholic in queens, life for ll was heart-breaking. his father shot his mother and grandfather, nearly killing them both. when 4-year-old ll found them, blood was everywhere."  in an episode of finding your roots, smith learned that his mother was adopted by eugene griffith and ellen hightower. the series' genetic genealogist cece moore identified smith's biological grandparents as ethel mae jolly and nathaniel christy lewis through analysis of his dna. smith's biological great-uncle was hall of fame boxer john henry lewis.smith began rapping at the age of 9, influenced by the hip-hop group the treacherous three. in march 1984, sixteen-year-old smith was creating demo tapes in his grandparents' home. his grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, bought him $2,000 worth of equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. his mother was also supportive of his musical endeavors, using her tax refund to buy him a korg drum machine. smith has stated that by the time he received musical equipment from his relatives, he "was already a rapper. in this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. it's like speaking spanish if you grow up in an all-spanish house." this was at the same time that nyu student rick rubin and promoter-manager russell simmons founded the then-independent def jam label. by using the mixer he had received from his grandfather, smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout new york city, including def jam.


== musical career ==
in the vh1 documentary planet rock: the story of hip hop and the crack generation, smith revealed that he initially wanted to call himself j-ski but did not want to associate his stage name with the cocaine culture (the rappers who use "ski" or "blow" as part of their stage name, e.g., kurtis blow and joeski love, were associated with the rise of the cocaine culture, as depicted in the 1983 remake of scarface.) under his new stage name, ll cool j (an abbreviation for ladies love cool james), smith was signed by def jam, which led to the release of his first official record, the 12-inch single "i need a beat" (1984). the single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. smith later discussed his search for a label, stating "i sent my demo to many different companies, but it was def jam where i found my home." that same year, smith made his professional debut concert performance at manhattan center high school. in a later interview, ll cool j recalled the experience, stating "they pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my dj, cut creator, started playing. ... as soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. right then and there i said 'this is what i want to do'." ll's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both def jam as a label and smith as a rapper. the commercial success of "i need a beat", along with the beastie boys' single "rock hard" (1984), helped lead def jam to a distribution deal with columbia records the following year.


=== 19851987: radio ===
radio was released to critical acclaim, both for production innovation and ll's powerful rap.
released november 18, 1985, on def jam recordings in the united states, radio earned a significant amount of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time. shortly after its release, the album sold over 500,000 copies in its first five months, eventually selling over 1 million copies by 1988, according to the recording industry association of america. radio peaked at number 6 on the top r&b/hip-hop albums chart and at number 46 on the billboard 200 albums chart. it entered the top r&b/hip-hop albums chart on december 28, 1985, and remained there for forty-seven weeks, while also entering the pop albums chart on january 11, 1986, remaining on that chart for thirty-eight weeks. by 1989, the album had earned platinum status from the recording industry association of america (riaa), with sales exceeding one million copies; it had previously earned a gold certification in the united states on april 14, 1986.
"i can't live without my radio" and "rock the bells" were singles that helped the album go platinum.  it eventually reached 1,500,000 copies sold in the us.with the breakthrough success of his hit single "i need a beat" and the radio lp, ll cool j became one of the early hip-hop acts to achieve mainstream success along with kurtis blow and run-d.m.c.. gigs at larger venues were offered to ll as he would join the 1986-'87 raising hell tour, opening for run-d.m.c. and the beastie boys. another milestone of ll's popularity was his appearance on american bandstand as the first hip hop act on the show, as well as an appearance on diana ross' 1987 television special, red hot rhythm & blues.
the album's success also helped in contributing to rick rubin's credibility and repertoire as a record producer. radio, along with raising hell (1986) and licensed to ill (1986), would form a trilogy of new york city-based, rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop. rubin's production credit on the back cover reads "reduced by rick rubin", referring to his minimalist production style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. this style would serve as one of rubin's production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions. rubin's early hip hop production work, before his exit from def jam to los angeles, helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry.


=== 19871993: breakthrough and success ===
ll cool j's second album was 1987's bigger and deffer, which was produced by dj pooh and the l.a. posse. this stands as one of his biggest-selling career albums, having sold in excess of two million copies in the united states alone.  it spent 11 weeks at no. 1 on billboard's r&b albums chart.  it also reached no. 3 on the billboard's pop albums chart. the album featured the singles "i'm bad", the revolutionary "i need love" - ll's first #1 r&b and top 40 hit, "bristol hotel", and "go cut creator go".
while bigger and deffer, which was a big success, was produced by the l.a. posse (at the time consisting of dwayne simon, darryl pierce and, according to himself the most important for crafting the sound of the lp, bobby "bobcat" ervin), dwayne simon was the only one left willing to work on producing ll cool j's third album walking with a panther.  released in 1989, the album was a commercial success, with several charting singles ("going back to cali," "i'm that type of guy," "jingling baby," "big ole butt," and "one shot at love"). despite commercial appeal, the album was often criticized by the hip-hop community as being too commercial and materialistic, and for focusing too much on love ballads.  as a result, his audience base began to decline due to the album's bold commercial and pop aspirations. according to billboard, the album peaked at no. 6 on the billboard 200 and was ll cool j's second #1 r&b album where it spent four weeks.
in 1990, ll released mama said knock you out, his fourth studio album. the marley marl produced album received critical acclaim and eventually went double platinum, selling over two million copies according to the riaa. mama said knock you out marked a turning point in ll cool j's career, as he proved to critics his ability to stay relevant and hard-edged despite the misgivings of his previous album.  ll won a grammy award for best rap solo performance in 1992 for the title track.  the album's immense success propelled mama said knock you out to be ll's top selling album of his career (as of 2002) and solidified his status as a hip-hop icon.


=== 19932005: continued success and career prominence ===

after acting in the hard way and toys, ll cool j released 14 shots to the dome. the album had four singles ("how i'm comin'", "back seat (of my jeep)", the strangely titled "pink cookies in a plastic bag getting crushed by buildings", "stand by your man") and guest-featured labelmates lords of the underground on "nfa-no frontin' allowed".  the album went gold.
ll cool j starred in in the house, an nbc sitcom, before releasing mr. smith (1995), which went on to sell over two million copies. its singles included "doin' it" and "loungin". another of the album's singles, "hey lover", featured boyz ii men, and sampled michael jackson's "the lady in my life"; it eventually became an early hip-hop music video to air on vh1. the song also earned him a grammy award. yet another single from the album, "i shot ya remix", included debut vocal work by foxy brown.
in 1996, def jam released this "greatest hits" package, offering a good summary of cool j's career, from the relentless minimalism of early hits such as "rock the bells" to the smooth-talking braggadocio that followed. classic albums including bigger and deffer and mama said knock you out are well represented here. in december 1996 his loose cover of the rufus and chaka khan song "ain't nobody" was included on the beavis and butt-head do america soundtrack & released as a single. ll cool j's interpretation of "ain't nobody" was particularly successful in the united kingdom, where it topped the uk singles chart in early-1997.
in that same year, he released the album phenomenon. the singles included "phenomenon" and "father". the official second single from phenomenon was "4, 3, 2, 1", which featured method man, redman & master p and introduced dmx and canibus.

in 2000, ll cool j released the album g.o.a.t., which stood for the "greatest of all time." it debuted at number one on the billboard album charts, and went platinum. ll cool j thanked canibus in the liner notes of the album, "for the inspiration". ll cool j's next album 10 from 2002, was his 9th studio (10th overall including his greatest hits compilation all world), and included the singles "paradise" (featuring amerie), "luv u better", produced by pharrell and the neptunes, and the 2003 jennifer lopez duet, "all i have". the album reached platinum status. ll cool j's tenth album the definition was released on august 31, 2004. the album debuted at no. 4 on the billboard charts. production came from timbaland, 7 aurelius, r. kelly, and others. the lead single was the timbaland-produced "headsprung", which peaked at no. 16 on the billboard hot 100. the second single was the 7 aureliusproduced, "hush", which peaked at no. 26 on the billboard hot 100.

"this song is the musical interpretation of what i felt after meeting with ncis agents, experienced marines and navy seals," ll cool j said. "it represents the collective energy in the room. i was so inspired i wrote the song on set."in march 2011 at south by southwest, ll cool j was revealed to be z-trip's special guest at the red bull thre3style showcase. this marked the beginning of a creative collaboration between the rap and dj superstars. the two took part in an interview with carson daly where they discussed their partnership. both artists have promised future collaborations down the road, with ll cool j calling the duo "organic" one early track to feature ll's talents was z-trip's remix of british rock act kasabian's single "days are forgotten", which was named by influential dj zane lowe as his "hottest record in the world" and received a favorable reception in both belgium and the united kingdom. in january 2012, the pair released the track "super baller" as a free download to celebrate the new york giants super bowl victory. the two have been touring together since 2011, with future dates planned through 2012 and beyond.

== legacy ==
with the breakthrough success of his hit single "i need a beat" and the radio lp, ll cool j became an early hip-hop act to achieve mainstream success along with kurtis blow and run-dmc. gigs at larger venues were offered to ll as he would join the 1986-'87 raising hell tour, opening for run-d.m.c. and the beastie boys. another milestone of ll's popularity was his appearance on american bandstand as the first hip hop act on the show.the album's success also helped in contributing to rick rubin's credibility and repertoire as a record producer. radio, along with raising hell (1986) and licensed to ill (1986), would form a trilogy of new york city-based, rubin-helmed albums that helped to diversify hip-hop. rubin's production credit on the back cover reads "reduced by rick rubin", referring to his minimalist production style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. this style would serve as one of rubin's production trademarks and would have a great impact on future hip-hop productions. rubin's early hip hop production work, before his exit from def jam to los angeles, helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry.radio's release coincided with the growing new school scene and subculture, which also marked the beginning of hip-hop's "golden age" and the replacement of old school hip hop. this period of hip hop was marked by the end of the disco rap stylings of old school, which had flourished prior to the mid-1980s, and the rise of a new style featuring "ghetto blasters". radio served as one of the earliest records, along with run-d.m.c.'s debut album, to combine the vocal approach of hip hop and rapping with the musical arrangements and riffing sound of rock music, pioneering the rap rock hybrid sound.the emerging new school scene was initially characterized by drum machine-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock, as well as boasts about rapping delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. in image as in song, the artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. these elements contrasted sharply with the 1970s p-funk and disco-influenced outfits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of acts prevalent in 1984, rendering them old school. in contrast to the lengthy, jam-like form predominant throughout early hip hop ("king tim iii", "rapper's delight", "the breaks"), new school artists tended to compose shorter songs that would be more accessible and had potential for radio play, and conceive more cohesive lps than their old school counterparts; the style typified by ll cool j's radio. a leading example of the new school sound is the song "i can't live without my radio", a loud, defiant declaration of public loyalty to his boom box, which the new york times described as "quintessential rap in its directness, immediacy and assertion of self". it was featured in the film krush groove (1985), which was based on the rise of def jam and new school acts such as run-d.m.c. and the fat boys.the energy and hardcore delivery and musical style of rapping featured on radio, as well as other new school recordings by artists such as run-d.m.c., schooly d, t la rock and steady b, proved to be influential to hip hop acts of the "golden age" such as boogie down productions and public enemy. the decline of the old school form of hip hop also led to the closing of sugar hill records, one of the labels that helped contribute to early hip-hop and that, coincidentally, rejected ll's demo tape. as the album served as an example of an expansion of hip hop music's artistic possibilities, its commercial success and distinct sound soon led to an increase in multi-racial audiences and listeners, adding to the legacy of the album and hip hop as well.in 2017, ll cool j became the first rapper to receive kennedy center honors.


== personal life ==
ll met simone johnson in the late 1980s. the couple had one son and one daughter together and married in 1995. two more daughters followed.ll eventually reconciled with his father.
