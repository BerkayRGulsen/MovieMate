== plot ==
gabriel yulaw (jet li), once an agent of the multiverse authority (mva) which polices interdimensional travel, seeks to hunt down all variations of himself in alternate universes. by killing 124 versions of his other selves and absorbing their life energies, yulaw believes that he will become a superpowered-godlike being called "the one". 
after killing lawless, the 123rd variation in the anubis universe, yulaw is captured by mva agents rodecker (delroy lindo) and funsch (jason statham) and taken back to the mva headquarters in the alpha universe. after he is sentenced to life in the stygian penal colony in the hades universe, yulaw manages to escape and teleports to the charis universe where the last variation of himself lives.
the last known variation, gabe law, is a police officer working in the los angeles county sheriff's department. for two years, gabe has been experiencing increases in strength, speed, and mental ability, but neither he nor his wife t.k. (carla gugino) can understand why. while transporting a prisoner, gabe "feels" yulaw's presence in time to avoid being shot. gabe sustains an injury after falling from a wall which yulaw scales with ease. rodecker and funsch arrive in time to stop yulaw from finishing off gabe.
although unfamiliar with interdimensional travel, gabe realizes that yulaw is identical to him in every way. rodecker and funsch track yulaw to the hospital where gabe is being examined. yulaw deters them from shooting him because if he is killed, gabe would then be left as the one. dressed alike and identical to each other, gabe and yulaw's battle confuses the other police officers. both gabe and yulaw manage to escape the hospital.
the mva agents deviate from their orders and split up. rodecker pursues and fights yulaw but is killed when the latter breaks his neck. funsch catches up with gabe and explains to him that there are multiple universes with wormholes briefly connecting them at uncontrollable times. yulaw sneaks into gabe's residence where t.k., believing him to be gabe, agrees to hide him from the police. she realizes that yulaw is deceiving her but not in time to avoid being captured. gabe arrives, only to watch helplessly as yulaw kills t.k. funsch finds a guiltridden gabe and both team up to find yulaw at the next wormhole.
gabe and funsch arrive at an industrial plant, where they encounter and fight yulaw. funsch is easily defeated but gabe and yulaw are more evenly matched. gabe manages to gain the upper hand but only seconds before the wormhole arrives. all three of them are sucked into it and collapse on the floor of the mva headquarters. yulaw is transported immediately to the hades universe after a failed attempt to switch places with gabe. the mva then prepares to send gabe back to his own universe, where he will be arrested and put into prison for the crimes that yulaw committed. recalling an earlier conversation with gabe, funsch sends him to a different universe in which gabe can have a normal life again from when he first met t.k.
meanwhile, yulaw, now on the penal colony in the hades universe, declares that he will still become the one and then proceeds to battle a prison inmate. the camera then pulls back to show an army of other prison inmates taking on yulaw on top of a ziggurat.
