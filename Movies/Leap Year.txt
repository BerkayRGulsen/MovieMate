== plot ==
successful real estate stager anna brady is frustrated that her cardiologist boyfriend jeremy sloane still has not proposed to her after four years. she decides to travel from boston to dublin, to propose to him on february 29, leap day, while he is there at a conference. anna wishes to invoke an irish tradition, bachelor's day, that a man who is proposed to on leap day must accept the proposal.
during the flight, a storm diverts the plane to wales. anna hires a boat to take her to cork. the severity of the storm forces her to be put ashore at a small seaside village called dingle. anna requests declan o'callaghan, a surly irish innkeeper, to taxi her to dublin. at first he refuses, but after his tavern is threatened with foreclosure, he agrees to drive her for 500. along the way, he mocks her belief in a leap year tradition of women proposing to men.
a herd of cows blocks the road. anna steps in cow-dung while attempting to move the animals, and tries to clean her shoes while leaning on declan's car, which causes it to roll downhill into a stream. continuing on foot, anna flags down a van with three travellers who offer her a lift. ignoring declan's warning, anna hands them her luggage. they drive off without her. anna and declan make their way on foot to a roadside pub, where they discover the three thieves going through anna's luggage. declan fights them and retrieves anna's bag.
while waiting for a train, they ask each other what they would grab if their homes were on fire and they had only 60 seconds to flee. they lose track of time and miss the train. they are forced to stay at a bed & breakfast at tipperary, where they pretend to be married so that their conservative hosts will allow them to stay. during dinner, when other couples kiss to show their love for each other, anna and declan are "forced" to kiss as well. this stirs feelings that neither had expected. they sleep in the same bed, but do not admit their new feelings for each other.
while hitchhiking, anna and declan are caught in a hailstorm and take shelter in a nearby church, where a wedding is taking place. they are invited to the reception, where anna gets drunk. anna questions her own intentions with jeremy and realizes that she has feelings for declan. just as the two are about to kiss, anna vomits and passes out. the following day they arrive in dublin. declan reveals he was once engaged but his fiance ran off to dublin with his mother's claddagh ring and his best friend. anna suggests that while in dublin, he should ask for his mother's ring back. when they arrive at the hotel where jeremy is staying, jeremy surprises anna by proposing to her right in the lobby. seeing that declan had already walked out of the hotel, she accepts jeremy's proposal.
at their engagement party in boston, anna learns that jeremy proposed because he thought it was the only way to appease the co-op board of the apartment building the couple wanted to move into. dismayed, anna pulls the fire alarm and waits, testing the 60-second concept she discussed with declan earlier. jeremy retrieves all of their electronic materials and neglects to check for anna. anna realizes there is nothing in the apartment that means anything to her, including jeremy. meanwhile, in dublin, declan retrieves his mother's claddagh ring from his ex-fiance.
anna returns to the tavern in dingle, where declan has pulled together the balance he owed his property owner with the help of the community. she tells him she has broken off her engagement and proposes that they get together, and not make plans. declan leaves. thinking she has been rejected, anna rushes outside to the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea. declan emerges, revealing that he went out to retrieve his mother's claddagh ring. declan says he wants to make plans with her, and proposes on the cliffside. anna happily accepts. they drive away in declan's car, leaving their destination open to fate.
