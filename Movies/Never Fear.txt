== production ==
lupino had contracted polio in 1934 and suffered the same fevers and pains as does the carol williams character, and she also faced the same dark thoughts and fear that she would not walk again. lupino's major symptoms persisted for only a brief period of time, leaving her with minor problems in her leg and hand. she remained a supporter of causes to fight the disease, and never fear was released in 1949 at the height of the polio fear and outbreak.the rehabilitation scenes were shot at the kabat-kaiser institute in santa monica, california. many of the actors used were actual rehab patients at the institute, and a scene depicting a wheelchair square dance featured a group of real wheelchair dancers.


== reception ==
the film was not popular because of its subject matter and did not turn a profit for filmakers, lupino's production company.a variety review stated: "as written by ida lupino and collier young, the screenplay was psychologically sound in dealing with the emotional ups and downs of polio victims, and it is equally convincing as a documentary of treatment with effective shots of physical therapy."
