== plot ==
a malevolent, sentient extraterrestrial parasite lands inside a meteorite and goes into the town of wheelsy, south carolina, where it infects wealthy resident grant grant, taking over his body and absorbing his mind. with the alien in control of his body, "grant" begins to transform into a grotesque, tentacled monstrosity. he also abducts and infects a local woman, brenda, to serve as a breeder for his alien larvae. his wife starla becomes suspicious over the changes in his appearance and his behavior, leading to grant attacking her. when the police arrive to rescue starla, grant flees.
during their search for grant, a posse led by police chief bill pardy discovers brenda, whose body has become inhumanly bloated from the larvae impregnated inside her. they see the floor littered with the remains of dead animals. as brenda begs to be fed a possum, the slug-like larvae burst from her body, which infest everyone in town except starla, bill, mayor jack macready, and teenager kylie strutemyer. those infected by the larvae become part of a hive mind controlled by grant, who intends to consume all lifeforms until only his consciousness remains. however, grant also retains his love for his wife and seeks to be reunited with her. the survivors deduce that killing grant will eliminate the rest of the aliens before they are attacked by the infected townspeople. bill and kylie escape, but starla and jack are captured.
armed with a grenade to kill the monster, bill and kylie head to grant's home, where the infected are being absorbed by the increasingly-mutated grant. jack and others are turned into breeders for more larvae, while grant keeps starla uninfected in the hope of reclaiming her love. after euthanizing jack at his own request, bill tries to use the grenade, only for it to fall into a pool when grant knocks it away. grant subdues kylie with a couch and attempts to infect bill with his tentacles, but bill manages to attach one of the tentacles to a propane tank. filled with flammable gas, grant is shot by starla and explodes, killing the rest of the aliens in the process. with everyone else in wheelsy dead, the three survivors head off to seek help.
in a post-credits scene, a cat approaches grant's remains and becomes infected by the alien parasite.

== themes and influences ==
controversy ensued over the many similarities and plot-points shared with fred dekker's 1986 horror-comedy night of the creeps. according to journalist steve palopoli:

when the trailer for slither came out, internet boards about the movie suddenly lit up with protests from a legion of fans of the 1986 film night of the creeps. "alien slugs that turn people into zombies!" they cried. "what a rip-off!" i bring this up not because i think slither which is a tongue-in-cheek pastiche of at least a dozen '80s horror filmscould really be considered a rip-off of any one of them.
palopoli then goes on to directly compare slither to the aforementioned creeps as well as the 1975 film shivers. gunn has stated that both cronenberg's shivers and his 1979 film the brood were the two biggest influences on the story in slither, along with the 2000 manga uzumaki by junji ito.the film pays homage to other horror films, such as a farm being owned by castevet in reference to the satan-worshiping next-door neighbors in rosemary's baby. jack macready, the mayor of wheelsy, is named after kurt russell's characters jack burton and r.j. macready from the john carpenter films big trouble in little china and the thing.

=== box office ===
slither was "a box office flop", failing to recoup its production budget following its debut in the united states and canada on march 31, 2006 in 1,945 theaters.  in its opening weekend, the film grossed $3,880,270 and ranked #8 at the u.s. and canadian box office. slither grossed $7,802,450 in its theatrical run in the united states and canada. slither also under-performed in france, grossing $236,261 from 150 screens. the film grossed $5,032,486 as of february 6, 2008 in territories outside the united states and canada for a worldwide gross of $12,834,936. its box office performance was substantially less than its total budget of $29.5 million, including marketing costs; the production budget taking up about $15 million of the total.paul brooks, president of the film's production company, gold circle films, said the company was "crushingly disappointed" by the gross. universal distanced itself from slither's poor box office performance, citing their distribution of the film as merely part of a deal with gold circle.  the hollywood reporter speculated that slither's performance "might have killed off the horror-comedy genre for the near future." producer paul brooks offered this explanation about why slither failed to catch on with filmgoers:

i think that because it was comedy-horror instead of pure horror is where the problem lay. it's the first comedy-horror in a long time, and maybe the marketplace just isn't ready for comedy-horror yet. it's difficult to think of other explanations.
