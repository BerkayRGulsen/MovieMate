== baseball ==

coach andy lopez took over the gators baseball program in 1994, one season after leading the pepperdine waves to their first college world series championship.  in 1996, he coached the gators to a fifty-win season and a college world series bid.  by 2000, the program had seemingly hit a plateau and lopez was replaced.
pat mcmahon became the gators' head coach in 2001 after coaching the mississippi state bulldogs.  the gators' 2005 baseball season was the most successful to date, with the team winning the sec title, and earning a place in the college world series for the fifth time in school history.  the team advanced to the championship round against the texas longhorns, ultimately losing two games to none.
following their 2005 college world series run, the gators opened the 2006 season ranked number one in the polls, but struggled to finish 2828 record (1020 sec), and failed to qualify for the ncaa regionals.  after missing the ncaa regionals again in 2007, mcmahon was dismissed.former clemson tigers associate head coach kevin o'sullivan became the gators' new head baseball coach on june 13, 2007.  o'sullivan's gator teams showed immediate improvement and the gators finished the 2008 regular season with a 3024 record (1713 sec), and received an invitation to the ncaa regional in tallahassee.  the 2009 squad finished the regular season with a 3818 record (1911 sec), won the ncaa regional in gainesville, and advanced to the super regional before losing to the southern mississippi golden eagles.
o'sullivan's 2010 and 2011 gators finished their sec regular season play with identical 228 records, won the program's eleventh and twelfth sec championships, earned a berth in the college world series in both years, and advanced to the college world series final in 2011 before losing to south carolina two games to none.
the gators returned to the college world series in 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. in june 2017, florida won their first college world series championship, beating lsu two games to none in the best-of-three finals.the gators baseball team plays its home games at florida ballpark at alfred a. mckethan field.


== men's basketball ==

florida enjoyed limited success in men's basketball before the mid-1980s.  coach norm sloan's gators were invited to the national invitation tournament (nit)only the second time the team had been invited to a post-season tournament.  they returned to the nit in 1985 and 1986, and made their first appearance in the ncaa basketball tournament in 1987, when guard vernon maxwell led the team to the ncaa sweet sixteen.  the gators received invitations to the ncaa tournament in 1988 and 1989, but sloan was forced to resign at the outset of the 198990 season as a result of ncaa infractions.
coach lon kruger brought renewed success, and his gators reached the nit final four in 199192.  during the 199394 season, andrew declercq and dametri hill led the gators to their first ncaa tournament final four following a dramatic victory over the connecticut huskies in the ncaa regional final.

athletic director jeremy foley hired billy donovan as kruger's replacement in 1996.  donovan's recruiting prowess was evident early, as he landed recruiting classes with future nba players mike miller, udonis haslem and matt bonner.  donovan's gators advanced to the ncaa tournament final before losing to the michigan state spartans in 2000, and demonstrated a consistency previously unknown to the program as they received invitations to the ncaa tournament every year from 1999 through 2007, a team-record eight-year streak.
under donovan, florida won its first sec men's basketball tournament in 2005, when they beat the kentucky wildcats in the sec title game.
the 200506 team's 170 start was the best in team history, surprising many with a young, selfless squad led by four sophomores.  the team began the season unranked, but won its second consecutive sec tournament championship.  on april 3, 2006, the gators defeated the ucla bruins 7357 in the ncaa tournament championship game to win florida's first men's national basketball championship.  within days, all five starters announced they would return for another season to try to win back-to-back championships.
at the outset of the 200607 season, the gators were ranked no. 1 in both major polls for the first time.  the gators won their second consecutive ncaa national men's basketball championship on april 2, 2007, defeating the ohio state buckeyes 8475.  they became the first team since duke in 199192 to win back-to-back tournaments and the first in ncaa history to do so with the same starting line-up.  afterward, florida's four star juniors announced they would enter the nba draft.

donovan's gators returned to championship form in 201011, winning the program's fifth regular season sec championship and fighting their way to the ncaa regional semifinals (the "elite eight") before losing 7471 to the butler bulldogs in overtime.  in 201112, the gators received a no. 7 seed in the ncaa tournament, exceeded expectations, and advanced to the elite eight, headlined by the play of star freshman bradley beal and point guard erving walker, before falling to louisville.  during the 201314 season, the gators were ranked no. 1 in the nation, won the sec championship with 36 straight wins during the regular season and tournament games, went on a school-record 30 game winning streak, and advanced to the ncaa final four, headlined by the play of four senior veterans: patric young, scottie wilbekin, will yeguete and casey prather.
the gators men's basketball team is currently led by coach mike white, and plays its home games in the o'connell center. white's gators returned to the ncaa tournament in 201617 after a two-year absence despite finishing second in the sec during the regular season and suffering an early exit from the sec tournament. the gators, as a #4 seed, ultimately reached the elite eight before falling short against fellow conference partner south carolina.


== women's basketball ==

women's basketball was approved as a new women's varsity sport by florida in march 1972, but began play in 1973 as a club team.  in 1975, the lady gators debuted as a varsity program under head coach dr. paula welch.  the gators made local headlines in 1976 by winning the "state championship", beating the other three women's college teams located in the state at that time.while traditionally being overshadowed by conference and national basketball powers tennessee and georgia, the lady gators have made several ncaa tournament appearances and sent players to the wnba, including delisha milton-jones.  carol ross compiled more wins than any other women's basketball coach in florida's history, and guided the team for twelve seasons from 1991 to 2003, but left to accept the head coaching job at her alma mater, ole miss.
from 2002 through 2006, the women's basketball team was coached by carolyn peck, a former wnba coach who won a national title with purdue.  peck was fired midway through the 2006 season (though allowed to finish the season) after enduring the worst losing streak of any gator sport.
former gator player and previous charlotte coach amanda butler was named the new women's basketball coach on april 13, 2007.  during the 200809 season, the lady gators received an ncaa tournament bid, and won a first-round game before being defeated by eventual tournament champion connecticut in the second round.  butler resigned after the 201617 season.

the gator football team has obtained more victories than any other program in the ncaa's football bowl subdivision (fbs) since 1990, the year heisman trophy-winning quarterback steve spurrier returned to his alma mater as head coach.  the 1996 team, coached by spurrier and led by another gator heisman-winner, danny wuerffel, finished with a 121 record and won the national championship in the sugar bowl, beating rival florida state 5220. this win was not without controversy from fsu fans who thought they should not have had to play florida again. fsu won in the regular season match up 2421.

== athletic program culture and traditions ==


=== colors and mascot ===

the university of florida began its sports program soon after it was established in gainesville in 1906, and its teams adopted orange and blue as their official colors soon thereafter. these colors are a probably a combination of the colors of the two primary institutions that merged to form the university, as the east florida seminary used orange and black and the florida agricultural college used blue and white.as with the school colors, the exact origin of the alligator (almost always shortened to "gator") as the school mascot is not well documented. it likely originated in 1908, when gainesville merchant phillip miller chose the animal to adorn pennants he designed for sale to students. the school did not yet have a mascot, and miller chose the alligator because it is native to florida and was not claimed by any other school. the football team subsequently adopted the "gators" nickname in 1911. there are two theories as how the name become synonymous with the university's athletic programs. one theory is that the 1911 football squad began calling themselves the gators in honor of team captain neal "bo gator" storter. storter himself refuted this explanation, saying that it originated when a sportswriter in south carolina described florida's 1911 road upset of clemson as an "invasion of alligators from florida" and the players adopted the name. whatever its origins, the nickname "gators" (and for a time, "lady gators" for women's sports) has been used by the university of florida's athletic program for over a century.


==== albert and alberta ====

albert and alberta are the official costumed mascots of the florida gators. many variations of albert have been present at sporting events over the decades, and a live alligator was used for many years. the current version of albert was introduced in the early 1980s, and alberta joined him in 1984. they are unique among the sec's mascots as the only male-and-female pair, and are featured together in a life-sized statue outside of uf's alumni affairs building.


=== other florida traditions ===

the "gator chomp" is a gesture made by florida gators fans and players to show their support of the florida gators sports teams.  the chomp originated in 1981.  the chomp is performed by fully extending one's arms, one over the other, in front of the body with the palms facing each other, and then moved apart and together to symbolize an alligator's mouth.  when performed by fans at home football or basketball games, the chomp is often accompanied by florida's marching band or pep band playing the two-note shark motif from the film jaws."orange and blue" is a fan cheer that is popular at home sports events, with alternate stadium sections yelling "orange!", and answering back with their loudest "blue!"  this can go back and forth for several minutes, with both sections competing to be the louder.
the football team had a long-time tradition of having george edmondson jr.  better known as "mr. two bits" wandering through the stands with a sign and a whistle to pump up the crowd to the "two bits" cheer.  edmondson officially retired in 2008, and was made an honorary alumnus in 2005.  his final appearance as mr. two bits was at the last home game of the 2008 season against the citadel.
the university of florida's marching band is known as "the pride of the sunshine", and plays at every home football game, and also performs at various events such as gator growl and parades.  the gatorettes are the baton-twirlers, or majorettes, for the marching band. the pride of the sunshine plays the university of florida alma mater at florida field before the start of every home football game.  following every home game, the entire football team gathers on florida field and joins fans in singing the alma mater while the band plays.  florida alumnus and former head football coach steve spurrier re-introduced this tradition to florida gators football games in 1990.
another football fan tradition, at home and on the road, is the gator fans' linking arms, swaying, and singing "we are the boys from old florida" at the end of every third quarter.  the university of florida's fight song, "the orange and blue", is played frequently at all florida gators athletic events.
the university of florida dance team that performs at home basketball games and other sports events is known as the dazzlers.
