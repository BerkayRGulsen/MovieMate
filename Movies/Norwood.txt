== reception ==
howard thompson of the new york times wrote that "the picture is a showcase for the guitar-playing campbell. and it is an entirely shapeless affair that simply bumps him around the country. a pity, too, for he is a pleasant, natural actor  'true grit' proved that  and he sings a clutch of guitar ballads easily and winningly." variety called it "little more than perpetuation of the elvis presley format for glen campbell, complete with a parade of pretty faces and uninspired countryish rhythm by presley tunesmith mac davis." gene siskel of the chicago tribune gave the film 1 star out of 4 and described its humor as "hokey, but harmless." charles champlin of the los angeles times called it "an amiable, easygoing, often quite funny piece of entertainment." richard combs of the monthly film bulletin wrote, "at its best, marguerite roberts' screenplay provides some amiable regional comedy; at its worst, when tidying up the novel's loose ends (complete to norwood's final appearance on country and western radio), it suggests how the material of midnight cowboy might have looked if turned into a vehicle for elvis presley."
