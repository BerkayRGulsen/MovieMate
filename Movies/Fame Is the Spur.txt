== critical reception ==
allmovie wrote, "sometimes slow-moving, this is an interesting look into the reasons why the labor [sic] and the conservative factions are at loggerheads with each other in great britain"; while bosley crowther in the new york times at the time of the 1949 american release thought, "this john and roy boulting film has vivid authority and fascination...but, unfortunately, a full comprehension of the principal character in this tale is missed in the broad and extended panorama of his life that is displayed...mr. redgrave is glib and photogenic; he acts the 'lost leader' in a handsome style. but he does not bring anything out about him that is not stated arbitrarily"; while the radio times reviewer david parkinson has praised redgrave's "powerhouse performance, with his gradual shedding of heartfelt beliefs as vanity replaces commitment having a chillingly convincing ring. but such is redgrave's dominance that there's little room for other characters to develop or for any cogent social agenda."
