== plot summary ==
david kolowitz (reni santoni) works as a delivery boy and assistant for a machine shop in new york city in 1938, and is fascinated with the movies.
despite the misgivings of his girlfriend wanda (janet margolin), his parents (shelley winters and david opatoshu) and his employer (jack gilford), david follows the suggestion of a friend (michael j. pollard) and becomes involved with an off-broadway theater company run by harrison b. marlowe (jose ferrer). he admires ronald colman so he uses the stage name "donald colman".
it is a margin operation that requires him to pay $5 a week for "tuition". marlowe's daughter (elaine may) takes a romantic interest in david, who perseveres despite a lack of acting talent and the hostility of marlowe.
overcoming all the difficulties, he makes his acting debut and his parents and girlfriend accept his new interest.
