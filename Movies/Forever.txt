== proposed film ==
famous players-lasky had planned in 1919 to bring all three barrymores, lionel, ethel and john to the screen in a lavish production of the du maurier novel peter ibbetson for that year. thereby john and lionel would repeat their 1917 broadway stage success. ethel had played a part in getting the play produced. john had been making comedies for the paramount for five years, ethel had been under contract to metro pictures but ethel's contract was ending that same year. lionel freelanced in and out of metro to companies like paramount and first national. if produced the film would have united all three barrymore siblings in their second film but also in the same scenes. a previous silent film national red cross pageant (1917) had all three siblings but not in the same scenes. never produced, the peter ibbetson project met the screen in the film known as forever with wallace reid and elsie ferguson.
