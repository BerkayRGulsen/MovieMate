== production ==
russell braddon's novel was originally set in england but was relocated to australia. burstall made the film as part of a deliberate effort to move away from "ocker material". he was attracted to braddon's novel because it would be simple to film as it was basically a two hander, while also preparing eliza fraser (1976). the movie was budgeted at $244,000 but eventually cost $294,000. shooting commenced in january 1975.
the two leads, george mallaby and john waters, were familiar faces on australian television at the time.


== reception ==
the film performed reasonably at the box-office and in 1979 reported that it had just broken even. it also rated highly on television, the rights for which earned hexagon $70,000. burstall admitted the film might have been more effective as a tv movie, but says it would have been harder to make a profit that way.the film is rated m in new zealand for violence and cruelty.
