== plot ==
it is stephanie's (angelica panganiban) wedding day, and her mother (cherry pie picache) tells her that it is an auspicious day for her wedding as a solar eclipse shall occur. precy (eugene domingo) is a single, middle-aged, and fiesty lawyer who was picked as a godmother in the wedding. medelyn (tuesday vargas) is an overworked nanny preparing her bratty ward, who will be a ring-bearer in the wedding. bien (jaime fabregas), the groom harold's (tom rodriguez) sickly grandfather, is paying for the wedding. toffee (john lapus), still love-embittered after his break-up, is part of the wedding's hair and makeup team.
as the wedding entourage makes their way to the venue in batangas, they traverse the magnetic hill in los baos, laguna. soon, the solar eclipse happens and they meet a freak car accident. as they regain consciousness, they realize the body switch: precy's soul goes to medelyn's body; medelyn's soul goes to bien's body; bien's soul goes to toffee's body; and unfortunately for stephanie, toffee's soul goes to her body and her soul goes to precy's body.
the souls in their new bodies nearly cause a ruckus right before the wedding: precy, in medelyn's body, disciplines her ward and gets a chance with love with the driver, ding (nico antonio); medelyn, in bien's body, is amazed with how she is treated in comfort because of his age and money; bien, in toffee's body, is sexually renewed and enamors mariz (cai cortez), the maid of honor; toffee, in stephanie's body, takes advantage of his new female physique; while stephanie, in precy's body, races time, distance, and a hospital confinement make it in time for her wedding. the wedding pushes through without much hitch.
after the wedding, stephanie and harold gathers precy, medelyn, bien, and toffee, and seek help from kuya kim atienza to fix the body switch. precy, medelyn, bien, and toffee, however, are apprehensive as they seem happy with the new bodies and circumstances they are in. kuya kim explains that the switch is because of the soul displacement due to the eclipse at the magnetic hill. he cautions that the souls may only revert to their original bodies if they would recreate the accident on the same hill during the next solar eclipse, which will happen in two years.
two years pass and they recreate the accident. on the first attempt, stephanie has the soul of medelyn, precy has the soul of bien, medelyn has the soul of toffee, toffee has the soul of precy, and bien has the soul of stephanie. on the second attempt, stephanie has with the soul of bien, precy has the soul of toffee, bien has the soul of precy, toffee has the soul of medelyn, and medelyn has the soul of stephanie. when they attempt for the third time, stefanie has the soul of precy, who has the soul of medelyn, who has the soul of bien, who has the soul of toffee, who has the soul of stephanie. they then attempt a fourth time, successfully.
