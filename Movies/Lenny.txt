the film jumps between various sections of bruce's life, including scenes of when he was in his prime and the burned-out, strung-out performer who, in the twilight of his life, used his nightclub act to pour out his personal frustrations. we watch as up-and-coming bruce courts his "shiksa goddess", a stripper named honey. with family responsibilities, lenny is encouraged to do a "safe" act, but he cannot do it. constantly in trouble for flouting obscenity laws, lenny develops a near-messianic complex which fuels both his comedy genius and his talent for self-destruction. worn out by a lifetime of tilting at establishment windmills, lenny bruce dies of a morphine overdose in 1966.
