garou's senses become extremely sharp, and his wounds heal near-instantly. as he investigates the case, he surprises jessica and his coworkers, all of whom had written him off as lazy and incompetent. as he goes over his notes at jessica's bar, she encourages him to drink more and invites him to join her privately. before he can, two criminals part of a local gang sneak into the bar and attack him in the bathroom. garou, who is in the middle of a transformation into a werewolf, easily kills one and drives off the other. angry that they did not kidnap garou, the gang leader stabs out the eye of the escaped gangster when he claims to have seen garou transform into a monster. meanwhile, garou ends up in higgins' house, handcuffed to the bed. higgins explains that he captured garou and restrained him for his own safety. higgins later researches his condition, and they learn that occult ceremonies in which a werewolf is sacrificed can strengthen the magic of reptilian shapeshifters.
garou and his partner, tina, investigate the deaths at the bar and a series of seemingly unrelated armed robberies by a gang who wear pig masks. higgins convinces garou that he must be restrained at night, and garou submits to being locked in the town's jail. however, when the police station receives a call for help, garou, who has since transformed into a werewolf but has retained his human intelligence, dons his policeman's uniform and heads to the local supermarket, where the pig-mask gang have taken hostages. garou savagely kills all the pig-mask robbers and heads toward a meth lab. higgins cowers in the car as garou again savagely kills several gun-wielding gangsters. when they return to the police station, jessica seduces garou while he is in his werewolf form, only to reveal that she is a shapeshifter and also the town's elderly mayor. higgins also reveals himself as a shapeshifter and theorizes that garou's alcoholism has made him stronger than their previous victims, all of whom they were able to control.
garou is drugged and brought to a second ceremony, where he is to be sacrificed during an eclipse so that the town's ruling elite, all of whom are reptilian shapeshifters, can continue to hide their true identity and rule indefinitely. tina arrives and confronts the police chief, who shapeshifts into the gang leader, and higgins. tina and garou kill higgins, jessica, and the gang members, but the chief surprises them with a sneak attack. weakened by the approaching eclipse, garou is wounded when shot by the chief, but he realizes that alcohol is the source of his enhanced power. as garou consumes a flask of alcohol, tina impales the police chief on a sword. he uses it to also stab her, but before he can finish her, garou shoots and kills the police chief. garou and tina limp off together, and garou promises to drop her off at a hospital after he gets another drink.
