== reception ==
liam lacey of the globe and mail remarked of the film, "the drama floats by like a bubble of yearning and delight, and then ends with a slightly silly pop. contrary to our expectations, this isn't really a version of before sunset set in the t.dot. it's a broken social scene movie, with a sweet tease of a story that pretends for a moment that toronto and paris could share an affair."
