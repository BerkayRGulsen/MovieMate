colleen is a common english language name of irish-american origin and a generic term for irish women or girls, from the irish cailn 'unmarried girl/woman', the diminutive of caile 'woman, countrywoman'.  
although it originates in the irish language, colleen as a given name has never been widespread in the republic of ireland, being far more popular in irish-descended communities in america, britain and australia. [1]
