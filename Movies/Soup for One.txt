soup for one is a 1982 american sex comedy film directed and written by jonathan kaufer and produced by marvin worth. while the film was a box office failure (mostly due to mixed reviews over its gratuitous sex scenes, including one involving s/m), it is best remembered for its soundtrack, which was produced by nile rodgers and bernard edwards of the group chic, who performed the title track.
