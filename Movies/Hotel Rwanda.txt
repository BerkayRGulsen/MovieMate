== plot ==
in april 1994, tensions between the hutu controlled government and tutsi rebels led to genocide in rwanda, where corruption and bribes between politicians were routine. paul rusesabagina, manager of the belgian-owned htel des mille collines, is hutu, but his wife tatiana is tutsi. their marriage is a source of friction with hutu extremists, including georges rutaganda, a goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of interahamwe, a brutal hutu militia.
paul curries favor with rwandan army  general augustin bizimungu, who favors the hutu. following the assassination of the president, a hutu, paul and his family observe neighbors being killed, initiating the early stages of the genocide. when civil war erupts and a rwandan army captain threatens paul and his neighbors, paul barely negotiates their safety and brings them to the hotel. upon returning with them, he finds his insolent receptionist gregoire occupying the presidential suite threatening to expose the tutsi refugees, including paul's wife, if he is made to work.
the un peacekeeping forces, led by canadian colonel oliver, are forbidden to intervene in the conflict and prevent the genocide. the foreign nationals are evacuated, but the rwandans are left behind.
more evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened united nations refugee camp, the red cross, and various orphanages, totaling 800, both tutsi and hutu. tatiana desperately searches for her brother, sister-in-law, and two nieces. as the situation becomes more violent, paul must divert the hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, protect his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning 4 star hotel. paul forces gregoire to work with the help of general bizimungu.
low on supplies, paul and gregoire drive to collect hotel supplies from georges rutaganda and witnesses tutsi hostages being raped by the interahamwe militia. georges explains to paul that the "rich cockroaches'" money is going to be valueless, because all of the tutsis will be dead. paul expresses disbelief that the hutu extremists will wipe out all of the tutsis, but georges replies: "why not? we are halfway there already." they return to the hotel through the dark, thick fog, of the riverside road recommended by georges, only to find it is carpeted with dead  bodies. 
when the un forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including paul's family, gregoire betrays them to the interahamwe, who use radio broadcasts to accost them. after giving general bizimungu the remaining valuables & scotch in his office safe to protect the refugees, paul then admonishes bizimungu for genocide apathy and promises to testify on his behalf for his help.
soon afterward, paul's family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a un convoy. they travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety behind tutsi rebel lines and are reunited with their nieces.
the end title cards explain that paul saved at least 1,200 tutsi and hutu refugees. he and his family, who adopted the two nieces, moved to belgium, but tatiana's brother thomas and his wife were never found. the genocide came to an end in july 1994 when the tutsi rebels drove the hutu and the interahamwe militia across the border into the congo. at least 1 million people died in the genocide. georges and the general were tried and sentenced for war crimes, with georges receiving a life sentence.

== production and historical accuracy ==
the film is set in 1994 during the rwandan genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 people, mainly tutsi, were killed by hutu extremists. during that year, rwanda's population of seven million was composed of two major groups: hutu (approximately 85%), and tutsi (14%). in the early 1990s, hutu extremists within rwanda's political elite blamed the entire tutsi minority population for the country's economic and political problems. tutsi civilians were also accused of supporting a tutsi-dominated rebel group, the rwandan patriotic front.on 6 april 1994, a plane carrying president juvnal habyarimana, a hutu, was shot down. following that incident, the genocide began. hutu extremists belonging to the interahamwe militia launched plans to destroy the entire tutsi civilian population. tutsi and people suspected of being tutsi were killed in their homes and as they tried to flee the country. it is estimated that some 200,000 people participated in the perpetration of the rwandan genocide. hotelier paul rusesabagina of the belgian owned luxury htel des mille collines, used his power and influence to personally save both tutsi and hutu refugees. rusesabagina regularly bribed rwandan hutu soldiers and kept militias outside the hotel's property during the hundred days of killing. following the carnage, rusesabagina survived along with his wife, four children, two adopted nieces; as well as most of the refugees he sheltered.sharing his thoughts about the lack of international intervention during the crisis, director george commented, "it's simple, ... african lives are not seen as valuable as the lives of europeans or americans." attempting to share the horrors of the genocide, george sought to tell the story of rusesabagina, portrayed as a humanitarian during the relentless acts of violence. however, rusesabagina has since come under criticism from allegations that he extorted money from hotel guests for rooms and food. it was also reported that the un headquarters in kigali received information that rusesabagina had provided a rwandan army commander with a list of hotel guests and their room numbers. un observers managed to change the room numbers of those most threatened. the character of the canadian colonel is based on senator romo dallaire, now retired lieutenant-general from the canadian armed forces. he recounted his own experiences in his biography, shake hands with the devil. the book was later adapted into two feature films; a documentary, and a 2007 dramatic motion picture.
george stated that it was important to craft the film for a mass-market audience, using the question of whether the film is "going to play in peoria? will it be understood? is it main stream [sic] enough?"


=== filming ===
principal filming was shot on location in kigali, rwanda, and johannesburg, south africa. paul rusesabagina was consulted during the writing of the film. although the character of colonel oliver played by nolte is fictional in nature, the role was inspired by the un force commander for unamir, romo dallaire. ugandan president yoweri museveni, then-rwandan president juvnal habyarimana, and rwandan patriotic front leader (now president) paul kagame appear in archive television footage in the film.
the producers of the film partnered with the united nations foundation to create the international fund for rwanda, which supported united nations development programme initiatives assisting rwandan survivors. "the goal of the film is not only to engage audiences in this story of genocide but also to inspire them to help redress the terrible devastation," said george.

== reception ==


=== critical response ===
among mainstream critics in the u.s., the film received universally positive reviews. rotten tomatoes reported that 91% of 194 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 7.95/10 and the consensus calling it a "sobering and heartfelt tale about massacre that took place in rwanda while most of the world looked away." at metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics' reviews, the film received a score of 79 based on 40 reviews.

michael rechtshaffen, writing in the hollywood reporter, stated actor "cheadle impressively carries the entire picture, delivering the kind of note-perfect performance that's absolutely deserving of oscar consideration." roger ebert in the chicago sun-times called it a "riveting drama", while exclaiming "the film works not because the screen is filled with meaningless special effects, formless action and vast digital armies, but because cheadle, nolte and the filmmakers are interested in how two men choose to function in an impossible situation. because we sympathize with these men, we are moved by the film." in the san francisco chronicle, mick lasalle wrote that the film was a "harrowing experience", and that "it documents for a mass audience what it was like. it's useful, in that it shows how it can happen. it's even hopeful, in that it shows that it's possiblenot guaranteed, but possiblefor people to maintain their humanity in the face of unhinged barbarism." claudia puig of usa today, stated the film was "one of the year's most moving and powerful films, anchored by a magnificent performance by don cheadle." she declared, "hotel rwanda emerges as an african version of schindler's list." the film however, was not without its detractors. dave sterrit of the christian science monitor, felt that although the subject matter was crucially important, he commented that "the movie dilutes its impact with by-the-numbers filmmaking, and cheadle's one-note performance displays few of his acting gifts." left equally unimpressed was lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly. commenting on the character significance of the u.n. personnel, she stated it was "a bad day for narrative, if not for diplomacy, when there is only one 3-d character among the entire u.n. lot, clad in their blue helmets, and that role is rasped by nick nolte with moral remorse rather than his more usual hint of dissolution." in her overall summation, she wrote "hotel rwanda is a strange history lesson that leaves us more overlectured than properly overwhelmed." michael atkinson of the village voice, added to the negativity by stating the film was "told to us secondhand, or glimpsed in distant scuffles" and "like the majority of movies about the last century of holocausts, hotel rwanda is as earnest and tasteful as its creators. to capture the white-hot terror of social calamity, someone a little more lawless and fierce might be called for."writing for the new york times, stephen holden wrote the film was "a political thriller based on fact that hammers every button on the emotional console." he commended how the film "offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked" while also praising "mr. cheadle's magnificent, understated portrayal". james berardinelli, writing for reelviews, called the film "powerful" and noted that it didn't "pull as many punches as its detractors would have us believe." berardinelli also wrote the film was "brutal and shocking when it needs to be, but it also has great emotional scope and power. we find ourselves enmeshed in paul's struggle, sharing his despair at the warfare tearing apart his country, his frustration and anger at the u.n.'s inability to act, and, eventually, his hope for a better tomorrow." describing some pitfalls, jeff vice of the deseret news stated the "decision by the filmmakers to show things from that limited viewpointto show how isolated and fearful the characters were of the chaos going on around themthe film feels a little dishonest and diminished. it's never quite as effective as the killing fields or schindler's list in that the film's overall impact is not as great and it doesn't linger in the memory." vice however was quick to admit "hotel rwanda does have its share of powerful moments; in particular, a scene in which paul and another hotel employee unknowinglydue to fogdrive into a mass grave." he also expressed satisfaction with the acting, stating "cheadle brings a needed intensity to the film; his character's fear and compassion are quite vivid. nolte is also good in his limited screen time, as is joaquin phoenix, who plays a news cameraman."

eleanor r. gillespie of the atlanta journal-constitution, stated that hotel rwanda was an "unforgettable film" as well as being "a doubly unforgettable performance by don cheadle." although mentioning "the parallels with steven spielberg's schindler's list are obvious", she praised individual cinematic elements that made the film unique, such as "the revelation of a dark, bumpy road paved with thousands of corpses. or in a little girl's heartwrenching plea, 'please don't let them kill me. i promise i won't be tutsi anymore'." she concluded her review with cheadle's noteworthy performance, stating he gave "one of the best performances (if not the best) of last yearan oscar-worthy portrait of a man who kept his head clear and his humanity intact in the midst of a man-made hell." similarly, david ansen wrote in newsweek that "two performances carry the film. cheadle, in his richest role since devil in a blue dress, burrows deep inside this complex man, who discovers in himself a strength he never knew he possessed, as he faces the disillusionment of all the "civilized" notions he believes in. as his strong, committed wife, tatiana, sophie okonedo, barely resembling the saucy hooker she played in dirty pretty things, is a revelation." however, in the arizona daily star, phil villarreal was not moved by the lead acting of cheadle or nolte. he thought the characters were "cardboardish" and stated the "uplifting moments of rescue seem antiseptic and set up." critic leonard maltin wrote that hotel rwanda was a "powerful film" that he thought avoided being "overly didactic by focusing on one compelling character, believably brought to life by cheadle." in reel power: hollywood cinema and american supremacy, drawing on the work of journalist keith harmon snow and writer edward s. herman, author matthew alford called the film "sensitive, humane and powerful" but noted that it was "striking how the history of bloodshed has been spun in line with western interests".


=== rwandan government response ===
initially people associated with the rwandan government praised the film, but it turned to criticism after rusesabagina criticized kagame in a book. terry george defended rusesabagina and pointed to the earlier support from the rwandan government and the extensive research george did for the film show that the rwandan government criticism lacks merit.
