== reception ==
according to av club writer nathan rabin, ghosts is a "staggeringly blunt" allegory for jackson's life and pop culture status. rabin attributed its failure to jackson's place in the public imagination at the time, in light of jackson's recent divorce from lisa marie presley and the 1993 child molestation allegations against him.
