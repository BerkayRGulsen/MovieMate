the bwf world championships (formerly known as ibf world championships, also known as the world badminton championships) is a badminton tournament sanctioned by badminton world federation (bwf). the tournament offers the most ranking points, together with summer olympics badminton tournaments. the winners will be crowned as the "world champions" and awarded gold medals. however, it does not offer any prize money.the tournament started in 1977 and was held once every three years until 1983. however, the ibf (international badminton federation) faced difficulty in hosting the first two events as the world badminton federation (which later merged with the ibf to form one badminton federation) hosted the same tournament a year after the ibf world championships with the same goals. started 1985, the tournament became biennial and played once every two years until 2005. starting 2006, the tournament was changed to an annual event on the bwf calendar with the goal to give more chances for the players to be crowned as official "world champions". however, the tournament is not held every summer olympics years.
