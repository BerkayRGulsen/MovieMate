== critical reception ==
mordaunt hall of the new york times wrote, "no, no, nannette, proves to be quite a merry affair with tunes that are now well known and players whose activities were rewarded with gusts of laughter from the first-night audience at warners' strand. it is a show that stirs up mirth from persons who might desire a more sophisticated type of entertainment, for its comedy of wives discovering the more or less harmless deceit of their husbands is invariably unfailing. the technicolor sequences are not always as well lighted as one would wish, but the staging of these tinted episodes is wrought with no little imagination, especially the glimpses of an airship with turquoise lights and a variety of colors on the fuselage. it is from this stage contrivance that bernice claire as nanette sings one of her songs. her partner, tom trainor, played by alexander gray, is also moved to song. the most effective stretches of this diversion, however, are those in black and white."
