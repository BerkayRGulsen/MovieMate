the music for the film was composed by bappi lahiri, one of the leading music directors of the time. the film has a memorable number "gori hai kalaiyaan, tu laade mujhe hari hari choodiyaan", with voices lent by lata mangeshkar and shabbir kumar, which earned great popularity that year. during those days, when cable television and dish tv facilities were not as popular in india as they are today, this song was often telecast in some programmes of doordarshan as a trendy track of that period. picturised on amitabh bachchan and jaya prada, the song charmed the listeners, and today it is considered as one of the evergreen songs of the 90s. lyrics written by anjaan.
