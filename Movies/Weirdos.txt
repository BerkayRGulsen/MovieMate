the film was shot in colour and later converted to black and white. mcdonald stated, "it's always difficult to shoot black and white because the powers that be, or the funders, are often wanting colour because colour is a bit more normal. (but) in the independent world, sometimes it does offer you those other kind of freedoms like, 'let's go black and white!' and it's not for everybody, but a lot of people are like, 'wow, that's just so beautiful in black and white.'"the film's soundtrack includes a predominantly but not exclusively canadian lineup of rock and pop songs from the era, including harry nilsson's "i guess the lord must be in new york city", lighthouse's "love of a woman", gordon lightfoot's "summer side of life" and "cotton jenny", rush's "finding my way", edward bear's "last song", the stampeders' "carry me", crowbar's "oh, what a feeling", fm's "phasers on stun", patsy gallant's "from new york to l.a.", labi siffre's "crying laughing loving lying", murray mclauchlan's "down by the henry moore" and anne murray's "snowbird".
