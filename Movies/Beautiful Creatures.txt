== plot ==
in gatlin, south carolina, teenager ethan wate awakens from a recurring dream of a girl he has not met. he despairs his small-town existence and dreams of leaving for college. his first day of junior year, a newcomer lena duchannes resembles the girl ethan has been dreaming about. other students gossip about lena's reclusive uncle, macon ravenwood, suggesting her family are devil worshippers. on the way home, ethan nearly runs her over. giving her a ride, they bond over interests.
in class, a few students insist they can not be in class with lena, and pray to be protected from her and her family. visibly shaken, her class windows shatter, increasing fears and suspicions she is a witch. ethan and lena become friends and he gives her a locket he found at greenbriar. both touching the locket triggers a shared flashback to the civil war.  
macon, disapproving of their relationship, conspires with ethan's family friend, amma, to separate them. lena tells ethan that she and her family are "casters" capable of performing spells. on her sixteenth birthday, her true nature will reveal itself toward either the light or dark. 
complications arise when two powerful dark casters aim to push lena to the dark: ridley, lena's cousin, and lena's mother, sarafine, who did not raise lena and has possessed mrs. lincoln, the mother of ethan's friend link. 
sarafine foresees lena will become a powerful caster, wanting lena to use her power to purge the earth of humans, leaving just casters. the couple have another flashback of their past with the locket, revealing that their ancestors, caster genevieve duchannes and mortal confederate soldier ethan carter wate, were in love. ethan died in battle, and genevieve revived him. doing so laid a curse on all duchannes women; they will go dark on their sixteenth birthday. a mortified lena asks amma to help, being a seer and keeper of the caster library beneath the town library, extending all across the usa. the most ancient of the books reveals the secret to undoing the curse: someone lena loves has to die. unwilling to take ethan's life, lena erases his memories of their love.
seducing link, ridley gives him a bullet to use in the upcoming civil war reenactment of the battle of honey hill, also lena's sixteenth birthday, lena feels the shock of the curse being broken and runs to ethan, clutching his dying body as ridley and sarafine encourage her to accept the dark. she lashes out in anger, sending a huge tornado through the crowd, until ethan's body transforms into macon, who had disguised himself to be the sacrifice to lift the curse. as he is dying, he reveals that he promised ethan's mother to keep her son alive. these dying words encourage lena to "claim [her]self"; she causes the moon to disappear so it cannot claim her for the dark. allowing ridley to flee, she pulls sarafine from mrs. lincoln's body, powerfully sealing away sarafine's spirit.
six months later, a still-amnesiac ethan visits amma in the library before a college tour with link. lena gives him a book they had once shared as a present. lena is a half light/dark caster, like her mother and cousin. as link and ethan reach the town line, the town's burned exit sign reminds him momentarily, he gets out of the car, shouting lena. she hears his call and is freed of her dark side.

alcon entertainment purchased the rights to beautiful creatures in 2009, with director richard lagravenese signing on soon after to write and direct the movie. casting for the film began in late 2011, and in february 2012, viola davis was cast as amma. soon after, jack o'connell and alice englert were announced to be playing the lead characters of ethan wate and lena duchannes. o'connell later dropped out of the film due to a scheduling conflict, with alden ehrenreich assuming the role of ethan. further casting included emma thompson as sarafine and mrs. lincoln and jeremy irons as lena's uncle macon ravenwood. of the character of lena, englert stated that "lena is like most girls when you feel massively insecure".principal photography was originally scheduled to begin 23 april 2012, in new orleans, and took place, said lagravenese, beginning "i think, april 16th, and then we shot until june 26th, and then post[-production] was for me from july 5th to december 17th." lagravenese chose to incorporate practical special effects along with computer-based ones for certain scenes, as emmy rossum described: "[w]hen we walked on to the stage and realized the chandelier does actually move, the chairs did actually spin, the table did actually spin... it was all very exciting." on 19 september 2012, the first trailer for beautiful creatures was released.camille balsamo played genevieve katherine duchannes in a sequence cut from the film; lagravenese said:

there was one part that i shot on green screen where i had all these actresses playing all the different duchannes women from different periods [from the civil war on]. and my costume designer, jeffrey kurland, had gowns and things, one was from the turn of the century, one was from the 20s, one was from the 40s, one was from the '60s, and they were going to appear in the first flashback and at the end of the movie, and then i cut them. ... it was just an idea that didn't work.the original soundtrack album was composed by thenewno2 and released by watertower music. the style of the soundtrack was referred to as "swamptronic", a term coined by lagravenese, and it was recorded at abbey road. dhanni harrison, son of george harrison, used some of his fathers guitars and equipment in the recording of the soundtrack.

=== critical response ===
the film has received mixed reviews from critics. it has a 47% rating on review aggregation website rotten tomatoes, based on 169 reviews, with the site's consensus stating: "charming romantic leads and esteemed supporting cast aside, beautiful creatures is a plodding ya novel adaptation that feels watered down for the twilight set". 
on metacritic, the film received a score of 52% based on 40 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews.owen gleiberman, in entertainment weekly, gave the film a "b-", writing, "beautiful creatures is arriving in a market-place full of twilight junkies still eager for their supernatural teen-romantic fix, and the film's concept couldn't be clearer: it's twilight with the sexes reversed. this time it's the boy who's the mortal: moody, bookish ethan, the outsider in his sleepy small town." gleiberman added that though the film "is lushly pictorial and not-too-badly acted... the audience, like ethan, spends way too much time waiting around for lena to learn whether she's a good girl or a bad girl."the film review website screenrant called the film "a choppy and melodramatic experience with very little payoff beyond the central love story. worse yet, overlooking the usual on-the-nose dialogue about eternal love and sacrifice, this tale of star-crossed sweethearts is especially cheesy and unconvincing  even when compared to similarly heavy-handed young adult novel-turned-movies. fans of the supernatural romance subgenre will get about what they expect..."david denby of the new yorker wrote that the movie "is a classic example of the confusions and the outright blunders that can overtake talented people who commit themselves to a concept driven purely by the movie marketplace... alas, the satirical energy and ethan's bright talk dissipate after a while." he praises a scene from the civil war flashback which "appears as ethan and lena are watching a movie in a local theatre, but only they can see it" as "an interesting idea that i wish lagravenese had pursued as a parallel narrative. this kind of movie, however, demands not interesting ideas but whooshing spectacle and madly redundant climaxes and a soundtrack filled with thuds and a shouting female chorus."scott mendelson of forbes magazine called the film "shockingly good" and encouraged viewers who missed it to check it out on video.cinemascore audience polls gave the film a b grade.beautiful creatures was featured on episode 187 of the comedy podcast how did this get made.
