the tesseract, is a 2003 thriller film directed by oxide pang and starring jonathan rhys-meyers. it is based on the 1998 novel of the same name by alex garland.
the film examines four seemingly unconnected lives brought together through a theft in a bangkok hotel room (unlike the novel which is set in manila). the interactions of an english drug dealer, an english psychologist, a thai assassin, and an abused 13-year-old boy demonstrate that life is so complex that even the smallest events can have enormous, even fatal consequences (i.e. the butterfly effect).
