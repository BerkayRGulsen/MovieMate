swing your lady is a 1938 country musical comedy film directed by ray enright, starring humphrey bogart, frank mchugh, and louise fazenda. also featured in the cast is ronald reagan in one of his early roles.
bogart was apparently becoming very disenchanted with the film roles that warner bros. was offering him at this stage of his career; the following year he appeared in his only horror/sci-fi film, the return of doctor x, and these were two roles he never liked talking about when he became a major film star several years later; he considered his performance in swing your lady the worst of his career. swing your lady was listed in the 1978 book the fifty worst films of all time.
swing your lady features the first film performance by the vaudeville comedy troupe the weaver brothers and elviry. following this performance, the trio was picked up by republic pictures for a series of comedy films.
