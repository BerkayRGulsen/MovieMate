== plot ==
samir horn (don cheadle) is an arabic-speaking sudanese-american and devout muslim. his sudanese father was killed by a car bomb when he was a child. as an adult, samir is first seen operating as an arms dealer. while negotiating a deal with omar (sad taghmaoui) in yemen he is arrested and thrown into a yemeni jail. later, samir and omar become friends, and when omar's people arrange an escape, they take samir with them.  they meet fareed (alyy khan), a lieutenant in the al-nathir terrorist organization.  fbi special agent roy clayton (guy pearce) suspects samir has been radicalized and begins tracking him.
joining al-nathir, samir uses the skills he learned as a special forces engineer sergeant with the u.s. army special forces to bomb the u.s. consulate in nice, france.  it is revealed that samir is working under deep cover for a us intelligence contractor, carter (jeff daniels); samir is devastated when he learns that despite carter's covert efforts, innocent people perished in the consulate bombing.  
impressed with samir, fareed introduces him to leader nathir, who discloses a plot to place suicide bombers on 50 buses in the u.s. during thanksgiving and instructs samir to act as liaison to each of the al-nathir sleeper bombers.  later, carter unwittingly interrupts a meeting between samir and omar, and is killed by omar.
samir reveals his deep cover to agent clayton, who tracks him to halifax, nova scotia, canada. while investigating, clayton also discovers the deaths in nice were fake, save for one. while on board a cargo ship to marseille, france, samir kills nathir and fareed, and tells an enraged omar that by targeting innocents they betrayed islam.  samir then tells omar that he switched the bombers' emails and placed them all on the same bus, so all of them died without victims (except for the driver of the one bus).  the canadian police and the fbi break in, kill omar, and injure samir.
later, underneath the l in chicago, samir tells agent clayton he feels guilty for killing innocent people, and that the qur'an says that to kill an innocent person is to kill all mankind. clayton responds by noting that the qur'an also says that by saving an innocent person, he has saved all mankind, tells samir he is a hero, and assures him of a possible career with the fbi.
