== plot ==
two evil alien conquerors are sent to earth with the order to behead all humans within 48 hours. if they fail, they will be destroyed by croker, a 100-foot-tall (30 m) giant.
kenny (michael weston) witnesses the evil alien conquerors, my-ik (diedrich bader) and du-ug (chris parnell), as they arrive on earth, literally falling out of the sky with their beheading swords. he offers them shelter at his home, which he shares with ron, an unpleasant, oversexed infomercial producer.
the conquering duo have a chance to experience earth culture, where they become friends with kenny, develop a fondness for smirnoff ice and unexpectedly fall in love with two local women, who have a secret of their own. they begin to doubt what they were sent to do, but know they still must attempt to complete their impossible mission despite their lack of skill, any plan or experience.
the giant croker then arrives to destroy the two inept conquerors and the rest of the earth's population, but he shrinks down to normal size during transportation. delusional enough to still believe he is a giant, he attempts to wreak havoc on the town, obviously without success.
