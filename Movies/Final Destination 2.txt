== plot ==
exactly one year after the explosion of flight 180, college student kimberly corman is heading to daytona beach, florida, for spring break with her friends, shaina mcklank, dano estevez, and frankie whitman. while waiting on the entrance ramp to route 23, she has a premonition of a deadly pileup caused by a logging truck. she stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner evan lewis, mother nora carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son tim, businesswoman kat jennings, stoner rory peters, pregnant isabella hudson, high school teacher eugene dix, and deputy marshal thomas burke. while burke questions kimberly, the pileup occurs, but shaina, dano, and frankie are killed by a car carrier after burke saves kimberly at the last second.
after the survivors are questioned at the police station, evan is fatally impaled by a fire escape ladder while attempting to escape from a fire in his apartment. aware of death's presence, kimberly seeks help from clear rivers, the last survivor of flight 180 who committed herself to a psychiatric ward for protection after alex browning was killed by a falling brick. when kimberly informs clear that evan was the first of the highway survivors to die, unlike in her premonition, clear realizes that the survivors are dying in reverse order. meanwhile, tim is crushed by a windowpane while leaving the dentist with his mother. clear decides to help and introduces kimberly and burke to william bludworth, who tells them that only new life can defeat death. believing that the birth of isabella's baby would foil death's plan, burke sends fellow marshal steve adams to take her into custody while he gathers the other survivors in his apartment and explains death's plan to them. when nora attempts to leave via an elevator, a chain of accidents results in her head becoming trapped in the doors, and she is decapitated.
the survivors take kat's suv to track down isabella, who has gone into labor, prompting adams to rush her to the hospital. along the way, the survivors realize that the demises of the flight 180 survivors affected all of their lives even before the highway pileup by saving them from prior deaths, which explains why death is working backward this time. the suv then suffers a blowout, causing them to swerve into a stack of pvc pipes in a farm that penetrate the car and injure eugene. rescue workers arrive and assist the farm owners, the gibbons family, with rescuing the others while eugene is hospitalized. using the jaws of life, kat's rescuer accidentally activates her airbag, causing her head to be impaled on a pipe protruding from her headrest. her cigarette falls onto a gasoline leak from a news van that explodes, launching a barbed wire fence into the air that dismembers rory.
guided by a vision of a doctor named kalarjian who kimberly believes will euthanize isabella, kimberly, clear, and burke rush to a hospital to save her, only to find isabella and her baby unharmed. however, an explosion from an oxygen leak in eugene's ward kills both clear and eugene. kimberly realizes that isabella was never meant to die at all, deducing that her visions of "isabella" were actually of herself. kimberly remembers that only the creation of a "new life" can defeat death. she drives into a lake to drown herself, but is defibrillated and revived by dr. kalarjian, creating "new life".
later, kimberly and burke have a picnic with the gibbons and kimberly's father. the gibbons explain that their son brian was nearly hit by a news van after rory saved him earlier. as a result, they witness brian suddenly die in an explosion caused by a malfunctioning barbecue grill.

=== development ===
final destination was conceived by writers jeffrey reddick, james wong, and glen morgan from flight 180, a spec script intended for use in the x-files. the film premiered across the united states and canada on march 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. the film's success inspired new line cinema then-president of production toby emmerich to approach reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. reddick asserted that he "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again." unfortunately, wong and morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects the one and willard. instead, new line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator david r. ellis as director and writing partners eric bress and j. mackye gruber as co-writers."second unit is like an extension of directing, you're doing big action sequences on film and it was just something i was going after. once i got the offer from new line and we got a good script, it was kind of a natural transition," ellis professed. "i wanted our film to be able to stand alone but i watched final destination to see what they did that was so successful. i tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. i kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," ellis added. "we wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. when we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'how can we make death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" bress uncovered. on the other hand, producers craig perry and warren zide from zide/perry productions also returned and helped on financing the film, with perry stating, "we could have made no other movies and the first one still would have been a satisfying experience. but when we were given the opportunity to make a sequel, we jumped at it."


=== casting ===

one of the prior film's main characters, alex browning (devon sawa), was killed off-screen in the film. rumors indicated that sawa had a contract dispute with new line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, perry resolved the issue with the statement that "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or devon's unwillingness to come back." despite this, new line reinstated ali larter to reprise her character as clear rivers. "when new line asked me to come back, i thought it was great. they showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," larter revealed. larter indicated that clear "[has] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. by having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that death can't get her." tony todd also resumed his character as mortician william bludworth. "it's the same character that we saw before that the audience loved," ellis expressed.the role of kimberly corman was given to canadian actress a.j. cook, who previously starred in the 1999 film the virgin suicides. cook described her role as "a very strong girl, very determined because her mother died a year earlier, right in front of her eyes, so she had to grow up quick." ellis described her role as "a girl who can have some fun cause they're going on a trip and they're gonna have a good time, yet someone who can stand up to clear, to come and challenge clear on a race, and to bother with clear." cook added that "it's rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film, not to mention two [larter]." ellis and perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance, and she was hired instantly. "[we] were at the beginning of what's going to be a long successful career for her," perry cited.michael landes, who appeared in the tv series lois & clark: the new adventures of superman, was cast as thomas burke. landes defined him as "a real nice, decent guy who comes across this huge car accident [and] who is very intrigued to begin with" and as "the guy who bumps into the girl and he goes nuts as her protector." ellis pointed out that he "just wanted to find someone who's young and who can relate to these kids. it wasn't an older guy, but still strong enough and yet sensitive. [landes] brought this really good balance to his part." landes was cast a day after his audition, which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments.former living single star t. c. carson was hired as eugene dix. carson identified his role as "a very by-the-book type of person but soon has a change of heart as the corpses begin to pile up." the crew was enticed of carson's casting, with bress mentioning how his "originally envisioned woody allen-type of character has got ten more times life than it ever had. it's got ten times the personality, this charisma that t.c. brings to it...he's just such a great presence." similarly, perry was astonished by how carson "can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice." jonathan cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film house of the dead, was appointed as rory peters. cherry characterized rory as "a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'i don't really care at all', to 'oh my god, this is really happening!'"in the script, bress said that rory was his favorite character to write since "he's great comic relief, he's got a drug problem, he's funny, and he's all that." bress bragged that "cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. it's like 'oh yeah. that's good! that's better!'" "what i think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming sympathetic to rory. you like him at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you care about him because you realize that there's a place that humor comes from that we all share," perry appended.blackwoods actress keegan connor tracy played kat jennings. tracy claimed that "[kat] doesn't really buy it at first, but pretty soon even her cynical attitude can't ignore the truth of the situation they're all in." perry defined the role as "someone who is really so self-absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her." her casting was assessed by perry as "full of energy" and "embodies the self-aware nervous energy of kat. [tracy] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don't dislike so much that you don't understand why she is the way she is." rounding up the cast are lynda boyd (rachel todd in you, me and the kids) as widow nora carpenter and james kirk (kyle morgan in once upon a christmas) as her son tim carpenter, david paetkau (hunter kerrigan in just deal) as gambler evan lewis, justina machado (vanessa diaz in six feet under) as pregnant isabella hudson, and noel fisher (todd tolanski of x-men: evolution) as farmer brian gibbons. novice actors sarah carter, alejandro rae, and shaun sipos were hired as kimberly's friends shaina mcklank, dano estevez, and frankie whitman correspondingly. andrew airlie portrayed kimberly's father michael corman, while enid-raye adams appeared as dr. ellen kalarjian.


=== filming ===
like the first film, the film was shot in and around vancouver island. "we know the arena, we know the people up there and let's be honest, there's an enormous economic incentive to shoot there. we were very fortunate to get [unit production manager] justis greene, who's been working as a line producer up there for 30 years and who was able to get us the best crew working in town right now. it was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie," perry stated as the reason for the film's production in british columbia. british columbia highway 19 was utilized as route 23. the plaza of nations was used as a stand-in for ellis medical complex, the site of tim's death.the farm and lake scenes were filmed in campbell river and okanagan lake respectively, though it is depicted in greenwood lake, new york. "we shot part of it at the lake where it was 37 cold, which is beyond an ice cream headache. and the second stuff we shot in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence, that was in a 93 pool," landes clarified. cook and landes performed their own stunts in both sequences. "my biggest fear is being trapped in a car underwater. so it was kind of cool to face my fear and all that," cook divulged. "we took a couple of lessons with a scuba guide to be comfortable being underwater and breathing off the regulator," landes enunciated.to avoid confusion with larter and carter, cook was required to dye her hair brown for the role. "i like being a chameleon. it opens you up for so much more in this work. you don't get typecast," cook professed. landes also denied plots regarding thomas and kimberly's relationship. "it's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. they didn't want to go there, i guess. they did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn't want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. so what they have now, hopefully, is a little bit of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. so it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there's no real love story," landes articulated.


=== effects ===
digital dimension took charge of the visual effects of the film. cg supervisor jason crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. "they were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if cg would work. the timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our cg logs bouncing on the freeway. we sent a tape to vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with cg," crosby indicated. "it began with r&d on the log dynamics. scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. the results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through windshields killer instinct' we were looking for. by tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role."
senior technical director james coulter added creative 3d tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. digital artist edmund kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 cg logs of the film. hair shaders were also used for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a douglas-fir were also considered.in spite of this, there are no cg cars incorporated in the actual film. "it was a possibility in the beginning so we did some dynamics tests using the logs as rigid bodies to hit cars with soft body deformers on them, but when they were done shooting they didn't end up needing any cg cars," crosby avowed. lifecasts of the actors were also used for all of the death scenes, including the highway setting. landes experienced claustrophobia during the procedure. fake blood was also used, but cg blood was also shown.

=== critical response ===
on rotten tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 48% based on 111 reviews, with an average rating of 5.01/10. the site's consensus is that "this sequel is little more than an excuse to stage elaborate, gory scenes of characters getting killed off." on metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on reviews from 25 critics. in 2010, nick hyman of metacritic included final destination 2 in the website's editorial 15 movies the critics got wrong, denoting that "the elaborate suspense/action set pieces from the first two films are more impressive than most." audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "b+" on an a+ to f scale.negative evaluations condemned the film's plot, acting, and screenplay. roger ebert of chicago sun-times wrote that "perhaps movies are like history, and repeat themselves, first as tragedy, then as farce." james berardinelli of reelviews stressed that "the movie mandates complete gullibility and vacuous attention in order to work on any level." claudia puig of usa today complained that "there is an audience for a movie in which innocent people suffer hideous accidental deaths is troubling enough, but a group of creative people chose to direct their energies on this repulsive spectacle [which] simply provokes disgust." justine elias of the village voice asserted that "this risible thriller is merely a sadistic series of misread premonitions and vile murders." david grove of film threat stated that "[he] wasn't much scared by anything in final destination 2 which is silly and illogical." jeff vice of deseret news censured to "not even get into the awful script or the numbingly awful performances"; while bruce fretts of entertainment weekly reviled "everything else about the film is also deadly."some critics praised the film's comedic theme. a. o. scott of the new york times imparted "it's not as cheekily knowing as the scream movies or as trashily grand guignol as the evil dead franchise, but like those pictures it recognizes the close relationship between fright and laughter, and dispenses both with a free, unpretentious hand." c. w. nevius of san francisco chronicle conveyed its "funnier than the original." maitland mcdonagh of tv guide pronounced "if this is your idea of fun, step right up." william arnold of seattle post-intelligencer found it as "a series of grand guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs." marc savlov of austin chronicle admired how "it is surprisingly good fun for the current crop of horror films, reasonably well-plotted and full of jaw-dropping, white-knuckle scares. that said, it's most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended." nev pierce of bbc saw that "it's simple, but effective"; whereas sheila norman-culp of the atlanta journal-constitution proclaimed that "what final destination did for the fear of flying, final destination 2 does for the fear of driving."amongst the cast ensemble, carson, cherry, cook, landes, larter, and todd were prominent amidst the analysis for their performances as eugene, rory, kimberly, thomas, clear, and bludworth respectively. koehler of variety said that "carson as skeptical eugene energizes what had been a rote conception on the page"; "cherry offered some dry comic balance"; larter was "casted little light"; todd was squandered by his "single, distinctly flat scene"; and "the generally awful thesping, led by cook, whose blurry grasp of emotions betrays ellis' apparent disinterest in his actors." grove of film threat panned cook, uttering that "she's no great actress, but she's a real looker" and teased that "since when did a horror movie suffer from having two dumb blondes as leads", the other actress referring to larter, whom "spends the whole movie looking miserable with her frigid acting." dustin putman of themovieboy.com commented how "cook is serviceable as the premonition-fueled kimberly, but doesn't evoke enough emotion in the scenes following the brutal deaths of her close friends." robin clifford of reeling reviews stated that "cook was strident as the catalyst that sparks events with her premonitions of disaster and her fervent desire to cheat the reaper" whereas larter was "giving the smart-ass edge her character needs"; while brett gallman of oh, the horror! claimed that larter "is again the bright spot", along with cook and landes who were "serviceable as leads" and todd "whose purpose has still yet to be revealed in the franchise."
