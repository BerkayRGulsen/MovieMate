== plot ==
ella and her parents live happily in a large house with a few servants, until her mother falls ill. ella promises to follow her mother's dying wish: to have courage and be kind. years later, ella's father marries recently-widowed lady tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, drizella and anastasia. ella's father leaves on business, and lady tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, forcing ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move into the attic. when ella's father unexpectedly dies, lady tremaine dismisses the household staff to save money, and forces all of their chores upon ella. seeing ella's face covered in cinders after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her "cinderella".
distraught over her step-family's treatment of her, ella rides off into the woods, where she encounters kit, the crown prince, out hunting. he hides that he is a prince, and instead introduces himself as a palace apprentice. ella and kit take a liking to each other, but they part without him learning her name. the king discovers he has little time left to live, and urges kit to take a princess as his bride at the upcoming royal ball. kit persuades his father to invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom, hoping to see ella again.
as her step-family is leaving for the ball, ella attempts to join them, wearing a refashioned dress of her mother's. tremaine and her daughters destroy the dress and leave ella behind. she runs out to the garden in tears, and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be ella's fairy godmother. she magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, and a goose into the coachman. she then transforms ella's ripped gown into a beautiful ball gown, and gives her a pair of glass slippers. as ella departs, the fairy godmother warns her the magic will end at the last stroke of midnight, and casts a final spell to prevent ella's step-family from recognizing her.
at the ball, kit is delighted to see ella and gives her the first dance. the grand duke, having promised kit to the princess chelina of zaragosa for political reasons, expresses his annoyance and is overheard by lady tremaine. though surprised at kit's true identity, ella bonds with the prince. before she can tell kit her name, the clock chimes midnight and she flees the palace, losing one of her glass slippers. the grand duke pursues her; however, when the magic dissipates, cinderella is able to hide in the woods. she returns home and hides the remaining glass slipper under the floorboards.
the king dies, but not before giving his son permission to marry ella. now the new king, kit issues a royal proclamation professing his love for the mystery princess and requests she present herself. ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity. however, lady tremaine has found the slipper first, and declares she will only allow ella to marry kit on the condition that ella make lady tremaine head of the royal household and find respectable husbands for the stepsisters. ella refuses, and lady tremaine smashes the slipper and locks ella in the attic. she brings the remains of the slipper to the grand duke, who says he will agree to her terms if she keeps ella hidden forever.
the grand duke and the captain of the guard lead the search for the mystery princess, trying the slipper on every woman in the kingdom, but it refuses to fit anyone. at ella's house, the shoe fits neither stepsister; the company prepares to depart, but hear ella singing "lavender's blue". the grand duke urges them to leave, but kit, who has secretly accompanied them, commands the captain to investigate. the slipper fits ella, and she and kit promise to accept one another for who they truly are. as they leave, ella forgives her stepmother. soon after, lady tremaine, her daughters and the grand duke leave the kingdom, never to return. ella and kit marry and become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the same courage and kindness that ella had promised her mother.

=== development ===
in may 2010, following the box office success of tim burton's alice in wonderland, which was the second-highest-grossing film of 2010 and earned over $1 billion at the box office worldwide, walt disney pictures began developing a new film adaptation of cinderella, commissioning a live-action reimagining based on a script by aline brosh mckenna and produced by simon kinberg. in august 2011, mark romanek was brought on to direct. on february 29, 2012, it was announced that chris weitz would revise mckenna's script. in january 2013, romanek left the project due to creative differences, as he was developing a version that was darker than disney wanted. later that month, disney negotiated with kenneth branagh to take over as director.cate blanchett was the first actor to sign on, when it was announced in november 2012 that she would be playing lady tremaine, cinderella's evil stepmother. in march 2013, emma watson was in talks to play cinderella, but a deal could not be worked out. watson went on to play belle in disney's 2017 film beauty and the beast. gabriella wilde, saoirse ronan, alicia vikander, bella heathcote and margot robbie were also considered for the part, but deals could not be worked out due to scheduling and other conflicts.on april 30, 2013, lily james was cast as the title character. a week later, richard madden was cast as prince charming, who was named kit in the film. in june 2013, it was reported that holliday grainger and sophie mcshera joined the film as cinderella's two evil stepsisters, anastasia and drisella, respectively. later that month, helena bonham carter was cast as the fairy godmother. in august 2013, hayley atwell and ben chaplin joined the cast to play cinderella's mother and cinderella's father. in september 2013, stellan skarsgrd's role as the grand duke was confirmed. on september 23, 2013, it was announced that derek jacobi was cast as the king, prince kit's father, and nonso anozie as the captain, a loyal friend to the prince.according to walt disney pictures president of production sean bailey, studio chairman alan f. horn wished to make the film the "definitive cinderella for generations to come," and told him that "if you need to spend a little more, spend it, to make sure it's one for the time capsule."


=== costumes ===
three-time oscar-winning costume designer sandy powell was in charge of the costumes for the film. powell began working on concepts for the characters' looks almost two years before principal photography began in the summer of 2013. powell said she was aiming for the look of "a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s."for the fairy godmother, powell took a major departure from the animated film of the 1950s, instead giving actress helena bonham carter an opulent white ballgown, featuring fairy wings, puff sleeves and a very full skirt. the skirt also had battery lights underneath it, which carter said caused issues when filming scenes as the batteries would run low quite quickly.
for the stepmother and stepsisters, powell had a very clear idea about the look; "they are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outsidea bit too much and overdoneand ugly on the inside." the silhouette of the prince came from the original animation, however she created a more fitted look and less masculine colours. some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate madden's eyes.the ball gown was inspired by the disney animated film in its color and shape; "the gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. i wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolour painting." the dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. nine versions of the cinderella gown were designed, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10,000 crystals. it took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.the wedding dress was another difficult project. "creating the wedding dress was a challenge. rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, i had to do something completely different and simple... i wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train," said powell. it took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand-painted dress. while the crew photographed james in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire; the top layer of the dress had to be redone because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget constraints.for the glass slipper, powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. since glass does not sparkle, they decided to use crystal instead. swarovski partnered with disney to make the famous shoe. powell went directly to swarovski headquarters in austria to meet the product developers. it took 6 digital renderings of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none were actually wearable. consequently, the leather shoes james wore on set had to be digitally altered into crystal. alongside the slipper, swarovski provided more than 7 million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.


=== filming ===
principal photography on cinderella began on september 23, 2013. the film was shot at pinewood studios in buckinghamshire, england, and at various other locations including hampton court palace, blenheim palace, windsor castle, cliveden, old royal naval college, and black park. although the royal palace is mainly computer-generated, it was modeled after the zwinger in dresden, germany.
