el mariachi meets a child, whose father allegedly plays guitar for a living. he gives the boy some pointers. at the tarasco bar, el mariachi engages in a tense standoff with bucho's goons before a massive gunfight erupts. he kills everyone in the bar, but tavo, who was in a back room conducting illegal business, survives and follows him outside. on the street, tavo wounds el mariachi before being killed himself. carolina, the woman who el mariachi shields from tavo's bullets, takes him to her bookstore. bucho arrives at the bar to survey the carnage. paranoid, bucho orders his men to hunt down the man "dressed in black".

== production ==
rodriguez's friend quentin tarantino has a cameo as "pick-up guy". carlos gallardo, who played the title role of el mariachi, appears in desperado as campa, a friend of banderas' mariachi. since banderas replaced gallardo as the actor for the main character, the filmmakers re-shot the final showdown from el mariachi as a flashback sequence for banderas' character in desperado.ral juli was originally cast as bucho but died before production began on october 24, 1994.principal photography took place entirely in ciudad acua, mexico, across from del rio, texas.


=== rating ===
after it was submitted to the motion picture association of america, the film was granted an nc-17 due to graphic violence and it had to be severely cut for an r rating. among the scenes that were trimmed are the deaths of tarantino's character and his friend at the bar, as well as trejo's character. by far the most major excision came at the end of the film, which originally contained a large-scale shootout between el mariachi, carolina, bucho, and his thugs at bucho's mansion. owing to the amount of footage the mpaa demanded be removed from the scene, rodriguez elected to remove the sequence in its entirety, giving the film its current fade-out ending. two additional scenes were also deleted featuring the codpiece gun (seen in the guitar case). originally, the gun was used by el mariachi during the second bar shootout when he uses it to shoot the first thug before whipping out his pistols from his sleeves and finishing him off. in a second deleted scene, the crotch gun was to go off accidentally while banderas is in bed with hayek, blowing a hole through the guitar while they were playing it. the gun was eventually used in unrelated rodriguez's films from dusk till dawn and machete kills.
