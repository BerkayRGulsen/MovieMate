== critical reception ==
tv guide gave the film two out of four stars, calling it a "tight little thriller"; and bfi screenonline wrote, "the third alibi benefits distinctly from the assured economy of his (tully's) direction. compact, low-key, but exciting...this later work is, characteristically, constructed with precision; and moves smoothly and swiftly towards an effective and ingenious denouement."
