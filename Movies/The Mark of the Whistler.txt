== reception ==
bosley crowther, the film critic for the new york times, gave the film a mixed review, writing "the dodges by which a fellow successfully stakes a phony claim to a dormant account in a savings bank and swindles $29,000 lend some fair to middling interest to columbia's latest whistler-series filmone called the mark of the whistler...in this dubious demonstration, the film does present a criminal case with the patient documentation familiar in crime-and-punishment shorts. but the things that happen to this defrauder after he has got the cash are just the claptrap of cheap melodramaand they are bluntly presented that way."
