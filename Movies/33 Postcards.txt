== plot ==
mei mei (zhu lin) a 16-year-old chinese orphan who has been supported by donations from her australian sponsor dean randall (guy pearce), who sends her postcards that describe his family life. when her orphanage choir travels to australia to participate in an australian choir festival, mei mei takes the opportunity to find dean with the hope he will make her part of his family. however, mei mei discovers the shocking truth  dean is actually a convict in prison for manslaughter. seeing dean as her last chance at finding a home, mei mei decides to stay in sydney until dean gets his parole, in the meantime becoming naively entangled in the criminal world herself. to save mei mei from his own fate, dean must make an impossible sacrifice.

=== coproduction ===
33 postcards is an official film and television co-production in australia. the co-production is between australia and china, for which a co-production treaty did not exist prior to 2008. 33 postcards is only the second film to be produced under this treaty and the first co-production between nsw and china. this opportunity for co-productions to exist between china and australia is largely unrealised in both countries, but has been identified as a potentially lucrative endeavour.
