== critical reception ==
nikhat kazmi from the times of india rated the film 2.5 out of 5 saying, "quirky as it comes, but not enough of crookedness to pitch it in the league of johnny gaddar and the likes, emotional atyachar is a black comedy that mostly ends up grey". sukanya verma from rediff.com rated the film 1 out of 5 and said, "the only decent thing about this atyachar is that it wraps up in about 90 minutes".
