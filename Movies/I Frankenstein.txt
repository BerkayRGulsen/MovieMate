== plot ==
in 1795, dr. victor frankenstein creates a monster by putting together parts of corpses and reanimating them. horrified by his creation, frankenstein tries to destroy it, but the monster survives and murders his wife elizabeth. frankenstein chases it to the arctic, but he succumbs to the cold weather. when the monster returns home to bury frankenstein, it's attacked by demons, but then it's rescued by two gargoyles ophir and keziah. they bring it to a cathedral, where the monster meets the gargoyle queen leonore and her second-in-command gideon. leonore explains that they were created by the archangel michael to battle demons on earth and protect humanity. they name the creature "adam" and invite him to join them, but he declines and departs. he's then given baton-like weapons to protect himself, as more demons will come after him. the weapons allow him to "descend" demons (destroying their bodies and trapping their souls in hell) as they have the symbol of the gargoyle order carved on them.
for the next two hundred years, adam lives apart from society, killing any demon that pursues him and hiding from them. now in the modern day, adam confronts a group of demons, where a police officer accidentally gets killed. while adam is summoned by the gargoyles once more about the recent confrontation, where they decide to imprison him as punishment. a demon helek, who survived adam's attack, reports to his leader, the demon prince naberius, that adam is alive. naberius has disguised himself as billionaire businessman charles wessex and employs scientists terra wade and carl avery to conduct experiments to try to reanimate corpses. he sends a group of demons led by his most formidable warrior, zuriel, to attack the gargoyles' cathedral and capture adam so he can unlock the secret to resurrecting the dead.
in the attack, many demons are slain and 16 gargoyles, including ophir and keziah, are "ascended" (returned to and trapped in heaven), but zuriel sneaks in and captures leonore and takes her to an abandoned theater. adam interrogates a demon who tells him that they lured the gargoyles out in order to capture leonore so they can force the gargoyles to trade adam for her. gideon is instructed to trade adam to them, however, adam escapes after the attack. without adam, gideon instead offers to trade frankenstein's journal for leonore, which was found on adam's body on the night they found him. at the theater, gideon gives zuriel the journal and leonore is spared. adam follows zuriel to the wessex institute, where he discovers thousands of corpses underground and learns that naberius plans to recreate frankenstein's experiment by reanimating the corpses and using them as hosts for the descended demons so he can rebuild his armies and destroy humanity. adam retrieves the journal from terra and escapes the demons. he later tracks down terra and asks for her help. the two are then attacked by zuriel, where adam fights him and manages to descend him.
adam warns the remaining gargoyles of naberius' plan, agreeing to give them the journal if they get him and terra to safety. leonore agrees and when adam leaves, she secretly sends gideon to kill him after he retrieves the journal. after a violent fight, adam ascends gideon and then decides to burn frankenstein's journal and destroy its secrets before the gargoyles come after him. luring them out of the cathedral, adam leads them to the wessex institute, where they descend naberius's right-hand man dekar and then battle more demons. in the ensuing battle, adam goes into the institute to rescue terra, who had been kidnapped by naberius and forced to begin the process of reanimating the corpses. naberius overpowers adam and tries to have one of the demon spirits possess him, but it doesn't work because adam has developed a soul of his own. adam carves the gargoyle order symbol on naberius, descending him to hell. the institute collapses and falls into an abyss, where all the demons and all the possessed corpses are destroyed and naberius' plan is thwarted. leonore rescues adam and terra from falling into the abyss as well and they return to the cathedral.
leonore forgives adam for gideon's death and adam bids farewell to terra. in the ending scene, adam narrates that he will continue defending the world from demons as he declares himself frankenstein.

== themes ==
one key issue is whether adam was a monster or a man.  that was partly reflected in the choices different characters made throughout the movie to refer to adam as either him or it.  at one point, dr. wade delivered the key line, "you're only a monster if you behave like one."
the director has said adam earned a soul when he burned the journal, selflessly giving up his chance at a mate in order to save mankind.  he said when he talked to audiences, they understood that adam had earned a soul over the course of the movie, but different people had different ideas about what specific thing caused him to earn a soul.
at first queen leonore had hoped that adam would gain a soul.  but near the end of the movie, when he refused to help the gargoyles fight the demons, the director says queen leonore decided adam would never gain a soul, and that's why she ordered gideon to kill him.  at that point, everyone was against him, which is similar to the sort of isolation from the original frankenstein story.
the director said the archangels sent adam to the gargoyles, in response to queen leonore asking them for help.  he says that a lot in life, when you get what you need/hoped for, you don't recognize it.

== potential sequels and underworld crossover ==
much doubt has been cast over a sequel due to the film's lackluster box office performance, though kevin grevioux, creator of the graphic novel and the underworld film series, had earlier expressed interest in making more i, frankenstein films along with an underworld crossover film. he stated in a pre-release interview that, in an early draft of his screenplay, kate beckinsale would have made a post-credits cameo appearance as selene and that there would have been underworld easter eggs, but none of this was used.
