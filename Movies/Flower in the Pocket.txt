li ahh (lim ming wei) and li ohm (wong zi jiang) grow up motherless. their father sui (james lee) is a workaholic who spends most of his time mending broken mannequins. sui is an outsider to the two boys, the only legacy left by the woman he loved, or still loves.
while he shuts himself out from the world, the two brothers grow up with all the freedom of neglected children. they roam the streets; get into fights and other trouble in school. along the way, they adopt a stray puppy, which becomes the most important thing in their lives.
when the puppy is sent away for being a nuisance, the boys are devastated. sui is very much affected by his boys' strong emotional attachment to the puppy. for the very first time, he realises that he is still able to love and he's going to do something about it before it's too late.

== quotes ==
a touching and humanistic story that tells a neglected father-and-sons relationship with a sense of humour, while using a simply and beautifully composed cinematic style.

dariush mehrjuim, head of jury & iranian master cineaste, 12th pusan international film festivalflower in the pocket is constantly, quietly, astonishing. a little film with big, deep pockets, flower is equal parts childhood idyll, absurdist comedy, gentle social satire and family mystery.
