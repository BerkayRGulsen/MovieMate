== plot ==
ami hyga is an average high school girl whose world comes crashing down when her brother yu and his friend takeshi sugihara are killed by bullies, led by sho kimura. as ami tracks down sho, she discovers that the bullies are associated with a ninja-yakuza family. she goes after the clan for revenge, but they brutally overpower her, cutting off her left arm. ami escapes and seeks shelter with takeshi's parents, suguru and miki sugihara, two kindly mechanics who fit her with a multi-barrelled machine gun prosthetic. ami and miki (who uses a chainsaw) pursue the clan, massacring them one by one. their victims' families, meanwhile, band together to get revenge.
eventually, they reach the yakuza's hiding place. as the fight continues, miki loses her right foot and eventually dies. ami loses her machine gun during her fight with sho's father rygi kimura, but gets miki's chainsaw. finding sho with hostages to keep ami at bay, his mother violet kimura manages to disarm ami while attempting to kill her with her drill bra. noticing one of the hostages wet himself, ami takes advantage and trips violet onto the urine, electrocuting her. she then kills sho. feeling she has nothing left to live for, she attempts to commit suicide. at that moment, ami hears noise behind her and turns, sword at the ready.


== production ==
according to writer and director iguchi, the idea for the machine girl went back to a simple idea he had about a one-armed girl in a bikini looking for revenge. the idea for the machine gun arm came later.
