mad at the moon received mixed to negative reviews from critics upon its release. 
derek elley from variety wrote a particularly scathing review, stating, "a bad attack of miscasting and some klutzy development take[s] the shine out of mad at the moon... slimly plotted item may attract the midnight crowd at specialized outings but is unlikely to raise much of a howl with mainstream audiences."tv guide awarded the film a mixed two out of five stars, commending the film's ambiance, and cinematography; while criticizing the film's underdeveloped plot, minimal character development, and abrupt ending. fred beldin from allmovie gave the film a more positive review, commending the film's cast, cinematography, and soundtrack, writing "while horror and western fans won't have much patience with this deliberately paced romantic drama, mad at the moon is a unique meld of genre influences that succeeds on its own terms."
