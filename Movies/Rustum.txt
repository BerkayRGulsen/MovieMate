rostam or rustam (persian:  [rostm]) is a legendary hero in persian mythology, the son of zl and rudaba, whose life and work was immortalized by the 10th-century persian poet ferdowsi in the shahnameh, or epic of kings, which contains pre-islamic iranian folklore and history. however, the roots of the narrative date much earlier.
in the shahnameh, rostam and his predecessors are marzbans of sistan (present-day iran and afghanistan). rostam is best known for his tragic fight with esfandiyr, the other legendary iranian hero; for his expedition to mazandaran (not to be confused with the modern mazandaran province); and for tragically fighting and killing his son, sohrab, without knowing who his opponent was. he is also known for the story of seven labours. rostam was eventually killed by shaghad, his half-brother.
rostam was always represented as the mightiest of iranian paladins (holy warriors), and the atmosphere of the episodes in which he features is strongly reminiscent of the parthian empire. he rode the legendary stallion rakhsh and wore a special suit named babr-e bayan in battles.


== origins ==
while the narrative of the shahname is the definitive work on rostam, ferdowsi did not invent the character; rostam stories were popular date back to the seventh century in pars and originated much earlier, likely in eastern iranian-speaking territories. he famously wears the zn-i palang or "panther-skin garment":

the material surveyed so far proves that the rustam legend was fully formed and well known in western iran by the seventh century ad at the latest and in the eastern iranian lands by the early eighth century. in some recent publications frantz grenet has attempted to find pictorial allusions several centuries earlier, in the smurgh depicted on the buckle of shapur i (ad 240272) on the rag-i bb rock relief in northern afghanistan, and in the scene of a prince breaking in a foal depicted on an eastern sasanian silver dish attributed to the first half of the fourth century. nicholas sims-williams has referred to the personal name purlang-zin, spelt  in greek script, in a bactrian document which was almost certainly written in the fourth century under sasanian rule, claiming that this may be translated as the man with the panthers skin and that it represents a clear reference to the zn-i palang of rustam. [...] the first element of this name, is the bactrian word for panther or leopard.


== rustam's background ==

in the shahnameh, rostam is a native of zabulistan, a historical region roughly corresponding to today's zabul province, southern afghanistan. his mother rudaba was a princess of kabul. rostam is the champion of champions and is involved in numerous stories, constituting some of the most popular (and arguably some of most masterfully created) parts of the shahnameh. in shahnameh, rostamlike his grandfather samworks as both a faithful military general as well as king-maker for the kayanian dynasty of persia.
as a young child, he slays the maddened white elephant of the king manuchehr with just one blow of the mace owned by his grandfather sam, son of nariman. he then tames his legendary stallion, rakhsh.
the etymology of rostam's name is from common iranian "*rautas-taxma-, "'river-strong', i.e. 'as strong as a river', rostam's mother is rdba "(she) of the river water", and his father is zl, who has white hair.


=== birth and early life ===
rostam's mother rudaba, the princess of kabul, was known for her peerless beauty, and rostam's father was zl. zl was one of persia's most powerful warriors and a great general who conquered many rebellious tribes and ruled over zabulistan. zl was known for his wisdom and was unparalleled in riding and fighting on horseback. he once demonstrated his skills to emperor manuchehr to seek his approval to marry his lover rudaba.
in persian mythology, rudaba's labor of rostam was prolonged due to the extraordinary size of her baby. zl, her lover and husband, was certain that his wife would die in labor. rudaba was near death when zl decided to summon the simurgh. the simurgh appeared and instructed him upon how to perform a rostamzad, a caesarean section, thus saving both rudaba and the child.
after zl's father, sam came to know of his grandchild's birth, he rushed to see rostam and was overjoyed. rostam was brought up and trained by zl in warfare. when rostam single-handedly slew a mad elephant, his father sent him on his first military assignment.
rostam's task was to conquer the fortress on the summit of mt sipand where his great grandfather, nariman, once besieged it and was slain in the battle. rostam breached the fortress, defeated the enemy, ransacked its treasury and reported his success to his father, zl and grandfather, sam.


=== haft khan ===

he passes through a hero's journey to save his sovereign, kay kvus who is captured by the divs of mazandaran. this journey is called "rostam's seven quests".
there are some similarities between the legends of rostam and those pertaining to the great irish hero c chulainn. they both defeat a ferocious beast as a very young man, slay their sons in combat ("rostam and sohrab", a motif also found in the hildebrandslied), are virtually invincible in combat, and are murdered by treachery while killing their murderer on their last breath.two persian heroes, rostam and esfandiyr, share stories with the labours of hercules.


==== alternate views ====
it is written by the royal central asian society in the journal of the royal central asian society that the struggle between rostam and the div-e sepid "white demon" represents a struggle between persians and invaders from the northern caspian provinces.


=== death ===

in shahnameh, the life span of the heroes who are from the generation of sam yale (rostam's grandfather) is mentioned very long, and in the same way, the life span of rostam was about six hundred years, but he did not die a natural death. his half brother shaghad killed him, with throwing him in a well full of poisonous spears.in this incident, another of rostam's brothers named zavareh and rakhsh were also killed.


== descent and other relations ==

with tahmineh, princess of samangan, rostam had a son called sohrab, who was killed accidentally by his father in the time of kay kavus. in banu goshasp nama rostam later had a daughter called banu goshasp, who had a full brother called faramarz, and both became renowned heroes in turan and india. goshasp, through her marriage with giv had a son, bijan.
rostam had also a half brother called shaghad, who was always jealous of him and provoked his death.
just as famous as rostam was his horse rakhsh, which had an incredibly long life like rostam, due to divine protection, and died at the same time as rostam.


== historical basis ==

ernst herzfeld maintained that the dynasty of gondophares represented the house of suren, highest of the five premier families of parthian empire, invested with the hereditary right of commanding the royal armies, and placing the crown on the king's head at the coronation. probably when around 129 bce, nomad peoples, especially the indo-scythians (sacaraucae, old persian sakaravaka "nomadic saka or saraucae) and the tocharians attacked the eastern frontier of parthia, defense was entrusted by the parthian emperors to the surens; and the latter eventually not only repelled the indo-scythians, but pursued them into arachosia and the punjab, this event probably representing interitus saraucarum ( the perishing of the sacaraucae) of gnaeus pompeius trogus (prologue 42).
echoes of these events are preserved in the legends of the sistn cycle, partly incorporated in the shahnameh, but once also surviving as independent epics, such as the garspnma mentioned in the trikh-e sistn, and the ketb al-sakisarn cited by al-masudi. these related the deeds of the hero garshasp and his descendants, narimn, sm, zl or dastn, and above all of the latter's son rostam. it is difficult to relate the indo-parthian names known from coins and history to those of the epic, which are possibly honorific titles, since a recently reported silver coin describes gondophares (spelt in greek script hyndopharres) as surnamed sm. a single ruler may of course have received more than one such title, and the historical names may be repeated in succeeding generations.
