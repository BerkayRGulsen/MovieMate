== reception ==
it received mixed reviews and was considered that srikanth's role was "nothing much" and poonam kaur was good at being pretty in the film. shafi's action was "an overreacting act but did a good job with comedy." sayaji shinde was a "messed up role." ali, venu madhav, krishna bhagavan, and brahmandam "only blend a little comedy in the film." pradeep rawat played as the antagonist and had a perfect act. it was said s.v. krishna reddy "needs to do a better job with making people act."
