== etymology ==

the name friday comes from the old english fred, meaning the "day of frige", a result of an old convention associating the germanic goddess frigg with the roman goddess venus, with whom the day is associated in many different cultures. the same holds for fratag in old high german, freitag in modern german, and vrijdag in dutch.
the expected cognate name in old norse would be friggjar-dagr. the name of friday in old norse is frj-dagr instead, indicating a loan of the week-day names from low german; however, the modern faroese name is frggjadagur. the modern scandinavian form is fredag in swedish, norwegian, and danish, meaning freyja's day. the distinction between freyja and frigg in some germanic mythologies is contested.

the word for friday in most romance languages is derived from latin dies veneris or "day of venus" (a translation of greek aphrodts hmra,  ), such as vendredi in french, venres in galician, divendres in catalan, vennari in corsican, venerd in italian, vineri in romanian, and viernes in spanish and influencing the filipino biyernes or byernes, and the chamorro betnes. this is also reflected in the p-celtic welsh language as gwener.
an exception is portuguese, also a romance language, which uses the word sexta-feira, meaning "sixth day of liturgical celebration", derived from the latin feria sexta used in religious texts where it was not allowed to consecrate days to pagan gods. another exception among the romance languages is also sardinian, in which the word chenpura is derived from latin cena pura. this name had been given by the jewish community exiled to the island in order to designate the food specifically prepared for shabbat eve.in arabic, friday is  al-jumah, from a root meaning "congregation/gathering." in languages of islamic countries outside the arab world, the word for friday is commonly a derivation of this: (malay jumaat (malaysia) or  jumat (indonesian), turkish cuma, persian/urdu , juma).
in modern greek, four of the words for the week-days are derived from ordinals. however, the greek word for friday is paraskevi () and is derived from a word meaning "to prepare" (). like saturday (savvato, ) and sunday (kyriaki, ), friday is named for its liturgical significance as the day of preparation before sabbath, which was inherited by greek christian orthodox culture from jewish practices.
friday was formerly a christian fast day; this is the origin of the irish d haoine, scottish gaelic di-haoine, manx jeheiney and icelandic fstudagur, all meaning "fast day".
in both biblical and modern hebrew, friday is   yom shishi meaning "the sixth day."
in most indian languages, friday is shukravra, named for shukra, the planet venus. in bengali  or shukrobar is the 6th day in the bengali week of bengali calendar and is the beginning of the weekend is bangladesh.
in japanese,  (, kinybi) is formed from the words  (, kinsei) meaning venus (lit. gold + planet) and  (, ybi) meaning day (of the week).
in the korean language, it is  in korean hangul writing (romanization: geumyoil), and is the pronounced form of the written word  in chinese characters, as in japanese.
in the nahuatl language, friday is quetzalctnal ([ketsakoatona]) meaning "day of quetzalcoatl".
most slavic languages call friday the "fifth (day)": belarusian   pyatnitsa, bulgarian   petk, croatian petak, czech ptek, polish pitek, russian   pyatnitsa, serbian   petak, slovak piatok, slovene petek, and ukrainian '  p'yatnitsya. the hungarian word pntek is a loan from pannonian dialect of slavic language. the n in pntek suggests an early adoption from slavic, when many slavic dialects still had nasal vowels. in modern slavic languages only polish retained nasal vowels.


== folklore ==
friday is considered unlucky in some cultures.  this is particularly so in maritime circles; perhaps the most enduring sailing superstition is that it is unlucky to begin a voyage on a friday.  in the 19th century, admiral william henry smyth described friday in his nautical lexicon the sailor's word-book as:

the dies infaustus, on which old seamen were desirous of not getting under weigh, as ill-omened.
(dies infaustus means "unlucky day".)  this superstition is the root of the well-known urban legend of hms friday.
in modern times, friday the 13th is considered to be especially unlucky, due to the conjunction of friday with the unlucky number thirteen. such a friday may be called a "black friday".
however, this superstition is not universal, notably in scottish gaelic culture:

though friday has always been held an unlucky day in many christian countries, still in the hebrides it is supposed that it is a lucky day for sowing the seed. good friday in particular is a favourite day for potato plantingeven strict roman catholics make a point of planting a bucketful on that day. probably the idea is that as the resurrection followed the crucifixion, and burial so too in the case of the seed, and after death will come life?

== religious observances ==


=== christianity ===

in christianity, good friday is the friday before easter. it commemorates the crucifixion of jesus. as such, adherents of many christian denominations including the roman catholic, eastern orthodox, methodist and anglican traditions, observe the friday fast, which traditionally includes abstinence from meat, lacticinia, and alcohol on fridays of the year.traditionally, roman catholics were obliged to refrain from eating the meat of warm-blooded animals on fridays, although fish was allowed.  the filet-o-fish was invented in 1962 by lou groen, a mcdonald's franchise owner in cincinnati, ohio, in response to falling hamburger sales on fridays resulting from the roman catholic practice of abstaining from meat on fridays.in the present day, episcopal conferences are now authorized to allow some other form of penance to replace abstinence from meat. the 1983 code of canon law states:

canon 1250. the days and times of penance for the universal church are each friday of the whole year and the season of lent.
canon 1251. abstinence from meat, or from some other food as determined by the episcopal conference, is to be observed on all fridays, unless a solemnity should fall on a friday. abstinence and fasting are to be observed on ash wednesday and good friday.
canon 1253. the episcopal conference can determine more particular ways in which fasting and abstinence are to be observed. in place of abstinence or fasting it can substitute, in whole or in part, other forms of penance, especially works of charity and exercises of piety.the book of common prayer prescribes weekly friday fasting and abstinence from meat for all anglicans.in methodism, the directions given to band societies (25 december 1744) mandate for all methodists fasting and abstinence from meat on all fridays of the year.the eastern orthodox church continues to observe fridays (as well as wednesdays) as fast days throughout the year (with the exception of several fast-free periods during the year). fasting on fridays entails abstinence from meat or meat products (i.e., quadrupeds), poultry, and dairy products (as well as fish). unless a feast day occurs on a friday, the orthodox also abstain from using oil in their cooking and from alcoholic beverages (there is some debate over whether abstention from oil involves all cooking oil or only olive oil). on particularly important feast days, fish may also be permitted. for the orthodox, fridays throughout the year commemorate the crucifixion of christ and the theotokos (mother of god), especially as she stood by the foot of the cross.  there are hymns in the octoekhos which reflect this liturgically.  these include theotokia (hymns to the mother of god) which are chanted on wednesdays and fridays called stavrotheotokia ("cross-theotokia"). the dismissal at the end of services on fridays begins with the words: "may christ our true god, through the power of the precious and life-giving cross...."
quakers traditionally referred to friday as "sixth day," eschewing the pagan origins of the name. in slavic countries, it is called "fifth day" (polish: pitek, russian: , pyatnitsa).

=== islam ===

in islam, friday (from sun-down thursday to sun-down friday, simpler than midnight to midnight in a pre-clock age) is the day of communion, of praying together, often mistaken as the holy day of muslims corresponding to sunday in christianity and sabbath (friday evening to saturday evening) in judaism and sabbatarian christianity; yet the seventh day is the holy day of contemplation and rest also for muslims, as it is called  al-sabt   in arabic - the sabbath. friday observance includes attendance at a mosque for congregation prayer or salat aljumu'ah. it is considered a day of peace and mercy (see jumu'ah) as well as a day of rest.

according to some islamic traditions, the day is stated to be the original holy day ordained by god, but that now jews and christians recognize the days after. in some islamic countries, the week begins on sunday and ends on saturday, just like the jewish week and the week in some christian countries. the week begins on saturday and ends on friday in most other islamic countries, such as somalia, and iran. friday is also the day of rest in the bah faith. in some malaysian states, friday is the first week-end day, with saturday the second, to allow muslims to perform their religious obligations on friday. sunday is the first working day of the week for governmental organizations.
muslims are recommended not to fast on a friday by itself (makruh, recommended against, but not haram, religiously forbidden), unless it is accompanied with fasting the day before (thursday) or day after (saturday), or it corresponds with days usually considered good for fasting (i.e. day of arafah or ashura), or it falls within one's usual religious fasting habits (i.e. fasting every other day), then it's completely permissible.
muslims believe friday as "syed-ul-ayyam" meaning king of days. a narration in sahih muslim describes the importance of friday as follows.
"abu huraira reported the messenger of allah (pbuh) as saying: the best day on which the sun has risen is friday; on it, adam was created. on it he was made to enter paradise, on it he was expelled from it. and the last hour will take place on no day other than friday.
