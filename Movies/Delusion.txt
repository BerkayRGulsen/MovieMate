shortly after meredith begins working at fairlawn, langrock's adult grandson gabriel, who spent his life on a commune in arizona, comes to stay after the accidental death of his parents. after his arrival, a series of deaths begin to occur; meredith and ivar discover his dog hanging from a tree in the garden. wilfred also dies in what appears to be a suicide when he is found having jumped out the window of his room. gabriel makes sexual advances toward meredith, who finds herself increasingly uncomfortable around him.
