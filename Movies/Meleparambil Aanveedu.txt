=== development ===
after the success of jayaram  rajasenan team's ayalathe adyeham, they planned to do another family entertainer. at this time, lyricist gireesh puthenchery told an interesting story to jayaram about four bachelors with the youngest the one only educated, in a corleone-like family. jayaram, who was highly inspired by this probably untold story, decided to produce it himself. the thread was developed by gireesh and introduced to rajasenan. it was first developed into a novel and then to a complete film script. jayaram suggested goodknight mohan distribute it. however, mohan set an unusual demand to rajasenan, to include some experienced directors to supervise him on script. this was unacceptable to rajasenan and the project was shelved.
at this time, rajasenan was replaced from the crew of a political film, janam, produced by mani. c. kappan. kappan assured rajasenan to produce a film for him, obviously as a compensation for his move. the shelved story of meleparambil aanveedu was returned by mohan, for the reasonable amount of 20,000. calicut-based film writer raghunath paleri was selected to write the screenplay.
gireesh initially told the story to director shaji kailas, who turned down since he was interested in action films at that time, but offered to direct it some other time. later, kailas invited producer goodknight mohan to the film and after gireesh briefed the story, mohan immediately gave an advance of 10,000.
