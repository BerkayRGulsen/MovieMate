== plot ==
jayaraman was born blind, but has a heightened sense of smell, hearing and touch and is an expert in the martial art of kalaripayattu. part of a large family, he works as a lift operator and caretaker in a kochi apartment building and is struggling to earn money for his sister's wedding. jayaraman is loyal to krishnamoorthy, a retired supreme court chief justice who lives in the building, and accompanies krishnamoorthy unquestioningly on a long search for someone.
on one trip, krishnamoorthy tells jayaraman the story behind his search. years ago, a man named vasudevan was imprisoned by krishnamoorthy for a crime he did not commit; the judge followed the letter of the law, although he knew that vasu was innocent. as a result, vasu's family poisoned themselves. vasu, insane with grief, resolves to avenge his loss and tells krishnamoorthy that he will kill him and his family. vasu has been released from prison, and krishnamoorthy feels threatened.
krishnamoorthy has a young daughter, nandini, and is afraid that vasu will kill her if he learns of her existence. to keep her safe, he sent her to a convent school and she knows nothing about him. nandini's only link to her father is via jayaraman, who frequently visits her at krishnamoorthy's request. she asks jayaraman about her father at each visit, and he replies that he will bring him the next time.
krishnamoorthy asks jayaraman to help him transfer money from his bank account to another account he opened for nandini. to reduce scrutiny, they avoid an electronic transfer. jayaraman withdraws the money and gives it to krishnamoorthy; the transaction is seen by devayani, a divorcee and maid in the apartment building. krishnamoorthy puts the money in a safe in his apartment.
a large wedding takes place, to which everyone in the building is invited. jayaraman goes to krishnamoorthy's apartment after the party to find him dead and the money missing from the judge's safe. he senses the presence of someone else in the apartment; the killer tries to escape, but jayaraman subdues him. after learning jayaraman is blind, vasu, the killer sneak past him and escapes in a car.
in the chaos, it is discovered that krishnamoorthy's money is missing and the police accuse jayaraman of stealing it. they learn at the police station that devayani's brother had the money, but jayaraman is charged with murder. he vainly pleads for a chance to find the killer, whose presence he could sense. after jayaraman is beaten by the police during an interrogation, he fights back and escapes. he tries to hide nandini from vasu with the aid of his friend ganga, a police officer.
jayaraman reveals to ganga that nanidini is actually vasu's daughter, whom the madman is trying to kill. he, nandini and ganga hide in the convent under the mother superior's supervision. vasu arrives, and when he approaches nandini jayaraman calls his cell phone. when jayaraman hears the ringtone, he shoots vasu dead. the film ends with jayaraman and nandini beginning a life together as a loving father and daughter.

=== development ===
according to priyadarshan, he was in a traumatic state after separating from his wife lissy; he "couldn't think straight" and felt he had lost his "ability to make films". mohanlal encouraged him to return to work, but "not with another comedy" (on which they had frequently collaborated). they were scheduled to work on an untitled, multilingual film in late 2015. the principal photography, expected to begin in september, was first postponed until march 2016 and never begun due to unfavourable weather in russia (where the film was set). priyadarshan decided to go ahead with a new project, and began reading screenplays; the director also had a two-month commitment from mohanlal because of the other film.he chose a script by november, and it was reported that filming would begin in january 2016; mohanlal would join the set after finishing his commitment to janatha garage. in december, it was reported that filming would tentatively begin in february. in the same month, the film's title was announced; priyadarshan would take over the screenplay, based on a story by govind vijayan. the film was reported to be a thriller, with mohanlal playing a blind man falsely accused of murder. priyadarshan described it as a "cat-and-mouse game" with a "little bit of humour too". ooty and kochi were scheduled as the primary filming locations.oppam was conceived as a crime thriller and developed from the gist of a short story by vijayan. mohanlal discovered the story and sent it to priyadarshan. when the director pointed out several logical errors in the story, mohanlal asked if he could rework it into a screenplay. priyadarshan was intrigued by its premise of a blind man witnessing a murder. after spending a month working on it, priyadarshan told mohanlal that it can be made into a film and took two more months to draft a screenplay. according to the director, oppam was the most challenging screenplay he had written to date. priyadarshan said in january that filming would begin on 20 february, but in february he was still working on the screenplay's final draft and casting.although it was reported in december 2015 that g. p. vijayakumar would produce oppam for seven arts international, the film was produced by antony perumbavoor through his company, aashirvad cinemas. director i. v. sasi's son, ani, was an associate director, and priyadarshan's son sidharth was an unofficial assistant director. in a later interview, in 2019, priyadarshan said that mohanlal had contemplated on directing oppam (which would have been his directorial debut) but later he decided against it.


=== casting ===
priyadarshan tailored the lead character, jayaraman, for mohanlal (his regular collaborator) when he wrote the screenplay. tamil actor samuthirakani was cast after mohanlal in december 2015, with the rest of the cast and crew yet to be finalised. vijay menon dubbed for samuthirakani's character. even though mohanlal has acted temporarily blinded characters, oppam was the first film in which he played a blind character throughout the film. mohanlal told priyadarshan that he would not act like a stereotypical blind man (blinking and look up), but like a sighted person. they had visited a school for the blind in chennai for pre-production research, and saw children playing and running between obstacles as if they could see. priyadarshan had also known blind men whose other senses were keen. the character of jayaraman has exceptionally sharp senses, and an expert in martial art of kalaripayattu.in a january deccan chronicle article, sanchita shetty said that she liked the screenplay and would play a substantial role in her malayalam film debut. the following month, priyadarshan confirmed that vimala raman would play one of the film's two lead female roles; shetty was on the shortlist for the other role. vimala said that her role was jayaraman's love interest, and the role is different from what she has done to date. anusree was later cast in the other role, since priyadarshan wanted an actress who "look[ed] very much a malayali". she played ganga, a newly appointed assistant commissioner of police whose grandfather is visually-impaired; she trusts jayaraman, and helps him uncover the truth. anusree was so looking forward to act in a priyadarshan directorial that she did not ask about her role when he called.in february, baby meenakshi was confirmed in a significant role with mohanlal. kalabhavan shajohn confirmed his role that month as a villainous character. sreeya ramesh was confirmed in an unidentified role in april, and sasi kalinga in june. mamukkoya played comic security guard kunjikka, who was unable to get names right, mistakenly substituting them with islamic names. aju varghese had a brief role as an auto rickshaw driver in scenes with mohanlal and samuthirakani. varghese, a fan of priyadarshan's films, requested a role in oppam. devshi khanduri made her malayalam debut as a punjabi girl in love with a malayali boy (arjun nandhakumar). priyadarshan described the film to nandhakumar during preparations for the 2016 celebrity cricket league.innocent played jayaraman's uncle, and anjali nair his sister. producer antony perumbavoor made a cameo appearance. chemban vinod jose, hareesh kanaran, renji panicker, kunchan, kalasala babu, idavela babu, sona heiden, kaviyoor ponnamma, and siddique also had supporting roles. in a december 2016 interview, dharmajan bolgatty said that he was offered a role in the film but could not commit due to scheduling conflicts.


=== filming ===
oppam began principal photography on 5 march 2016 in kochi, kerala. mohanlal joined the set that day, and vimala a week later. a large set was constructed for a north indian wedding with a song sequence with mohanlal and vimala and dancers in punjabi dress. the elaborately-produced song was completed in five days, and the dance was choreographed by kala. filming took place for three weeks at locations in thammanam, thrippunithura, and on marine drive in kochi. the first shooting schedule was finished by the end of march. the film's cinematographer was n. k. ekambaram.

=== post-production ===
post-production began as soon as the filming ended, and progressed in june and july 2016 at priyadarshan's four frames studio in chennai. oppam was edited by m. s. ayyappan nair, and the crew returned to chithranjali studio in early july for dubbing. composer ron ethan yohann began working on the score after editing was completed by the end of july, first spotting the film. the post-production progressed through august 2016. priyadarshan said that he reluctantly cut some of mamukkoya's comedy scenes to reduce oppam's length. its final cut censored by the central board of film certification was 157 minutes long.

"chinnamma adi" was sung by m. g. sreekumar, who also sang "minungum minnaminuge" with sreya jayadeep. "pala naallayi" was sung by a ten-voice ensemble. "chirimukilum" was not included in the film; it was a tribute to composer s. p. venkatesh, who had collaborated with priyadarshan on some of his successful soundtracks, and was written in venkatesh's style."chinnamma adi" was written by madhu vasudevan. priyadarshan wanted its first line to begin with a name, and "chinnamma" was added. for the second verse, mohanlal insisted on "kukkumma" (the pet name of actress sukumari, as a tribute to her). "minungum minnaminuge" was written by b. k. harinarayanan when his mother was in hospital, and his thoughts about how she cared for him were reflected in the song. its lyrics were written after the melody was composed, and the song's position in the film was described by priyadarshan. sharon joseph was recommended to 4 musics by composer mejo joseph for writing the hindi lyrics for "pala naallayi". sharon joseph sings and records her compositions, and when 4 musics heard her hindi recording she was invited to sing the original as well.
