== production ==
the movie was shot partly in hong kong and japan as well as aboard the uss los angeles. according to co-writer sy gomberg, audie murphy was extremely uncomfortable playing comedy. however, the movie was an enormous hit in japan, in part because of the japanese people's admiration for murphy, and partly because of its sympathetic depiction of the japanese. following the film, murphy brought home a 14-year-old japanese girl who stayed with the murphys and helped raise their children while she attended school in america.the original choice for the title character was meant to be david wayne who had appeared as sakini in the stage production of teahouse of the august moon.  when he was unavailable the role was taken by burgess meredith who also played sakini on stage.
