old nick tells joy that he has lost his job and threatens that he may not be able to afford their supplies in the future. that night, jack is overcome with curiosity and ventures out of the closet while old nick is asleep in bed with his mother. joy is horrified when she awakens and sees their interaction, slapping old nick away. as punishment, he cuts their heat and power. joy decides to tell jack about the outside world; he reacts with disbelief and incomprehension, but also curiosity. she has jack fake a fever, hoping that old nick will take him to a hospital where he can alert the authorities, but old nick says he will return the following day with antibiotics.
joy wraps jack in a carpet and has him play dead in the hope that old nick will remove him from room. falling for the ruse, old nick places jack in the back of his pickup truck and drives through a residential neighborhood. although stunned by his first exposure to the outside world, jack jumps from the truck and attracts the attention of a passerby. nick attempts to drag jack back to his truck, but fails in the process. he drops jack and flees the scene. the police arrive and rescue jack. the police discover joy as well, and take her and jack to a hospital. old nick is captured and arrested.

== production ==


=== development ===

emma donoghue, who also wrote the novel on which the film is based, wrote the screenplay for the film before the novel was published in 2010. she explained she felt sure the book could be made into a film because of its structured storyline, and received many offers from filmmakers after it was published, which she rejected for creative reasons. director lenny abrahamson read the novel and sent donoghue a 10-page fan letter telling her it should be a film, without knowing a screenplay already existed. donoghue felt the letter demonstrated an understanding of her work and advocated for him as director.in 2012, abrahamson and donoghue spent one week at her house in london, ontario as they revised the screenplay. she served as executive producer and was included in major filmmaking decisions. abrahamson credited donoghue with securing funding from canada, where she is a citizen. she also suggested shooting in toronto because it could resemble the united states. canadian producer david gross helped persuade his irish co-producers to shoot in canada rather than the u.s., saying they could have a longer schedule and more money in canada.


=== casting ===

emma watson, rooney mara, shailene woodley and mia wasikowska were all considered for the role of joy. brie larson was cast after an associate of abrahamson suggested he watch short term 12, in which she played the lead role. larson consulted with a trauma expert and nutritionist for the role, went on a restrictive diet, and avoided sunlight. she said she saw the film less as a crime story and more of "a story of love and freedom and perseverance and what it feels like to grow up and become your own person".the filmmakers considered dozens of child actors for jack before casting seven-year-old jacob tremblay from vancouver. tremblay said his role was not hard "because i was playing a happy child" unaware of the sinister nature of room. as he was too young to read the whole screenplay, each scene was explained to him one by one. tremblay wore a wig made from human hair. according to joan allen, who played nancy, larson and tremblay met for over three weeks to build a "very tight, obviously critical, close relationship", before the room scenes were shot over five weeks. allen arrived in toronto later and met tremblay, with allen noting, however, that "we didn't want him to become too familiar with me because that's not what the story is."in preparation for her own role, allen did not consult real mothers of kidnapped children, but said she reflected on her own experiences "in a mall when my daughter was little and i look around and within a flash she's not there". canadian actor tom mccamus auditioned for the part of old nick before being cast as leo. the actors improvised some lines, with donoghue saying they created "speech patterns more natural-sounding than i could have written, and produced some brilliant new lines that ended up in the film."


=== filming ===

abrahamson used only one room set, wanting to create an authentic experience for tremblay. the set, built on a soundstage at pinewood toronto studios, was 11 ft  11 ft (3.4 m  3.4 m). montreal production designer ethan tobman set out with the idea "that every square inch of room needed to have a backstory". to fit the crew and equipment into the small space, he made each piece of the set removable. however, as abrahamson and cinematographer danny cohen wanted the camera to always shoot scenes from inside room, the lens was always positioned within the set even if the rest of the camera was outside. there were as many as eight cameramen at a time inside the room set with larson and tremblay. the actors also made the props decorating the set.because the scenes set outside room were filmed after the scenes inside, the crew was initially eager to leave the cramped space, expecting that the rest of the film would be easy. however, they had difficulty adjusting to the cold weather, traffic and crowds in toronto. cohen remarked that upon returning to the room set for the final scene, the set appeared smaller to the crew. toronto also doubles for akron, where the exterior scenes are set.
cohen used a panavision primos lens on a red epic dragon camera, saying "the primos and using kino flos, which is more akin to fluorescent lighting, gave room a certain texture, a certain look." principal photography began on november 10, 2014 and wrapped on december 15, 2014.


=== post-production ===
editor nathan nugent served as second-unit director. he described his editing of room as simplistic, keeping the acting intact, while working in dublin for five months. however, tremblay's part was filmed in numerous takes so tremblay could give variations of his performances of specific lines, so abrahamson and nugent had to assemble and splice the different takes in the editing process.


== release ==
prior to production, a24 acquired u.s. distribution rights to the film. room had its world premiere on september 4, 2015, at the telluride film festival. it went on to screen in the special presentations section at the 2015 toronto international film festival. and at the london film festival, on october 11, 2015. the film began a limited release on october 15, 2015. room was released in the united kingdom and ireland on january 15, 2016, by studiocanal. it went into wide release on january 22, 2016.the film was released by lionsgate on dvd and blu-ray in the united states on march 1, 2016. it was released on dvd and blu-ray in uk and ireland in may 2016.

=== box office ===
after its u.s. release on october 16, 2015, room played in a peak of 198 theaters from december 11 to 13, and grossed $5,166,724 before its academy award nominations were announced, making it one of the lowest-grossing best picture nominees in years. initial box office under-performance came as a surprise to canada's elevation pictures, since winning the people's choice award at the toronto international film festival was usually a predictor of financial success. however, the nominations gave the film a boost at the box office, and after opening in the republic of ireland on 15 january, it initially made 200,000 at 50 theatres.a month after its release in ireland, it had grossed more than 1 million nationwide. on 24 april, room completed its run having grossed an estimated $14.7 million in north america and $20.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $35.4 million on a $13 million budget.
