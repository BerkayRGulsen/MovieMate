== plot ==
two years after the battle of new york, steve rogers works in washington, d.c., for the espionage agency s.h.i.e.l.d., while adjusting to contemporary society. during a mission alongside agent natasha romanoff and s.h.i.e.l.d.'s counter-terrorism s.t.r.i.k.e. team, led by agent rumlow, to free hostages aboard a s.h.i.e.l.d. vessel from pirates led by georges batroc, rogers discovers romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers. returning to the triskelion, s.h.i.e.l.d.'s headquarters, rogers confronts director nick fury and is briefed about project insight: three helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. unable to decrypt romanoff's data, fury becomes suspicious about insight and asks senior s.h.i.e.l.d. official and secretary of internal security alexander pierce to delay the project.
on his way to rendezvous with maria hill, fury is ambushed by assailants led by an assassin called the winter soldier. escaping to rogers' apartment, fury warns him that s.h.i.e.l.d. is compromised, but is wounded by the winter soldier, before handing rogers a flash drive containing the ship's data. fury is pronounced dead during surgery, and hill recovers the body. the next day, pierce summons rogers to the triskelion. when rogers withholds fury's information, pierce brands him a fugitive. hunted by s.t.r.i.k.e., rogers meets with romanoff. using the data, they discover a secret s.h.i.e.l.d. bunker in new jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of arnim zola. zola informs them that since s.h.i.e.l.d. was founded after world war ii, hydra has infiltrated and operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. the pair narrowly escape death when a s.h.i.e.l.d. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that pierce is hydra's leader within s.h.i.e.l.d.
rogers and romanoff enlist the help of former usaf pararescueman sam wilson, whom rogers befriended, and acquire his powered "falcon" wingpack. they capture s.h.i.e.l.d. agent jasper sitwell, a hydra mole, forcing him to divulge that zola developed a data-mining algorithm that can identify individuals becoming threats to hydra. the insight helicarriers will sweep the globe, using satellite-guided guns to eliminate them. sitwell is killed in an ambush by the winter soldier, whom rogers recognizes as bucky barnes, his childhood best friend who seemingly fell to his death on a mission, but was actually captured and experimented upon after wwii. hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where fury, who had faked his death, plans to sabotage the helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.
after the world security council members arrive for the helicarriers' launch, rogers broadcasts hydra's plot to everyone at the triskelion. romanoff, disguised as one of the council members, disarms pierce. fury arrives and forces pierce to unlock s.h.i.e.l.d.'s database so that romanoff can leak classified information, exposing hydra to the public. following a struggle, fury kills pierce. rogers and wilson storm two helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the winter soldier destroys wilson's suit and fights rogers on the third. rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. rogers refuses to fight the winter soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the triskelion, rogers falls into the potomac river. the winter soldier rescues the unconscious rogers before disappearing into the woods. with s.h.i.e.l.d. in disarray, romanoff appears before a senate subcommittee, while fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to eastern europe in pursuit of hydra's remaining cells. rogers and wilson decide to find the winter soldier, while rumlow, who was a hydra agent, is hospitalized following the triskelion's destruction.
in a mid-credits scene, baron wolfgang von strucker, at a hydra lab, proclaims that the "age of miracles" has begun as scientists examine an energy-filled scepter and two test subjects: one with superhuman speed, the other with telekinetic powers. in a post-credits scene, barnes visits his own memorial at the smithsonian institution.


== cast ==

chris evans as steve rogers / captain america:an avenger and a world war ii veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum, frozen in suspended animation, and is now struggling to adjust to the 21st century. describing his character's adjustment to the modern world, evans said, "it's not so much about his shock with [technology]... it's more about the societal differences. he's gone from the '40s to today; he comes from a world where people were a little more trusting, the threats not as deep. now, it's harder to tell who's right and wrong. actions you take to protect people from threats could compromise liberties and privacy. that's tough for steve to swallow." evans trained in "parkour, brazilian jiu-jitsu, karate, and boxing", as the russo brothers believed that rogers brought to the present "also meant that he had studied and mastered modern fighting styles and techniques." the filmmakers also looked to make the character's shield, which has traditionally been used for defense, a more offensive weapon.
scarlett johansson as natasha romanoff / black widow:an avenger and a highly trained spy and assassin working for s.h.i.e.l.d. who teams up with rogers. screenwriter christopher markus said that black widow was a "great contrast" to captain america, describing her as "incredibly modern, not very reverent, and just very straightforward whereas steve is, you know a man from the '40s. he's not a boy scout, but he is reserved and has a moral center, whereas her moral center moves." the russos added, "she's a character who lies for a living. that's what she does. he's a character who tells the truth. give them a problem and they'll have different ways of approaching it. she's pushing him to modernize, and he's pushing her to add a certain level of integrity to her life." when asked about romanoff's relationship with rogers, johansson responded, "by a series of unfortunate encounters, they will be in a situation in which their friendship becomes more intimate. they share many similarities because they live on the defensive without relying on anyone. also, the two have been working for the government throughout their professional careers. with their friendship they begin to question what they want and what is their true identity."
sebastian stan as bucky barnes / winter soldier:steve rogers' childhood best friend who has re-emerged as an enhanced brainwashed assassin after supposedly being killed in action during world war ii. regarding the character, feige said, "winter soldier has been methodically, almost robotically, following orders for 70 years." stan said despite his nine-picture deal with marvel studios including his appearance in the first avenger, he was not sure that bucky would make an imminent return, and only heard the sequel's official title was "the winter soldier" through a friend attending san diego comic-con. stan endured five months of physical training to prepare for the role and did historical research, stating, "i dove into the whole cold war thing. i looked at the kgb. i looked at all kinds of spy movies, and all kinds of documentaries about that time, and what it was about. i grabbed anything from that time period. anything about brainwashing." stan also practiced daily with a plastic knife in order to be able to do the winter soldier's knife tricks without the aid of a stuntman. regarding bucky's transition into the winter soldier, stan said, "you know, the truth of the situation is although he looks very different and there's different things about him, it still comes from the same person. i think you'll get to see that no matter what. i think part of my goal here was to make sure that you see an extension of that version but just a different color of that same version in a way. i think he's still the same guy; he's cut from the same cloth." stan said he felt the character's introduction in the winter soldier was "a preview of the guy," with more aspects of the character being explored in the film's sequel captain america: civil war.
anthony mackie as sam wilson / falcon:a former u.s. air force pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack. about the role, mackie said "[wilson is] a really smart guy who went through major military training and becomes a tactical leader." he also remarked, "he's the first african-american superhero. it makes me feel all the work i've done has been paying off. i have a son, nephews and nieces, and i love the idea that they can dress up as the falcon on halloween. they now have someone they can idolize. that's a huge honor for me." marvel, who cast mackie because of his "energy and sense of fun," did not let him read a script before signing on. mackie spent five months doing two-a-day workouts and eating an 11,000-calorie-per-day diet to get into shape for the role. commenting on rogers' relationship with wilson, evans said, "meeting mackie's character, he used to serve, now he works at the va counseling guys who come home with ptsdthey connect on that level. i think they're both wounded warriors who don't bleed on other people. cap has no one to bleed on. i think mackie knows how to handle people like that. ... sometimes when things are bad, trusting a stranger is the way to go."
cobie smulders as maria hill:a high-ranking s.h.i.e.l.d. agent who works closely with nick fury. smulders said she performed some of her own stunts in the film, explaining, "i try to do my own stunts whenever i can. you're only allowed to do certain stunts. there is an amazing team of stunt people that do most of the work in this film. but, i studied a lot of tae kwon do. i also did a lot of training just with weapons because i'm not very comfortable around guns. i had to get comfortable because that's my character's thing... i like to get really physical so i feel empowered when i am on set and even though you don't see it on screen, maybe i am taking people out that you don't see off camera."
frank grillo as brock rumlow:the commander of s.h.i.e.l.d.'s counter-terrorism s.t.r.i.k.e. team. grillo hinted in a june 2014 interview about the character's return in the sequel with the alter-ego crossbones. grillo signed a seven-film deal.
emily vancamp as sharon carter:a s.h.i.e.l.d. agent assigned to guard rogers without his knowledge. about the character, vancamp said, "i play agent 13 / sharon carter which everyone knows but we don't really touch on that in this film. we're just sort of introducing her. when we first see her we realize she's living next to captain america... they sort of have a little thing going on and as we all know in the comic books they had a love affair off and on for years. they had a very complicated relationship. it's almost as if they are planting the seeds now. sort of leaving room to go wherever they want to go with it." regarding her casting, joe russo said, "we wanted someone that cap would have an immediate interest in. it had to be a strong-willed person, and we felt that emily's work on revenge was a great test tube for what this character could be. she's obviously very credible with physicality, she holds the screen really well, and she even looks like the character from the books."
hayley atwell as peggy carter:a retired military agent with the strategic scientific reserve and co-founder of s.h.i.e.l.d. who is a former love interest of steve rogers. on receiving the script, atwell realized the character "would be 96, and i would be up to the eyeballs in prosthetics." the visual effects team was not satisfied with the initial make-up used to make atwell look older, and eventually resorted to aging her through cgi methods.
robert redford as alexander pierce:a senior official within s.h.i.e.l.d., member of the world security council, and old comrade of nick fury. redford was cast in part as an homage to his roles in 1970s thrillers such as three days of the condor, and for what the directors described as "an acting legend playing a villainous role" akin to henry fonda in once upon a time in the west. as to what attracted him to the film, redford said it interested him by being different from his usual work, and that he "wanted to experience this new form of filmmaking that's taken over where you have kind of cartoon characters brought to life through high technology."
samuel l. jackson as nick fury:the director of s.h.i.e.l.d. regarding fury's questionable code of ethics, jackson said, "almost everything that comes out of nick fury's mouth is a lie in some sense. he has to ask, is he even lying to himself, too? he has a very good idea of what's going on but his paranoia keeps him from believing some of it." jackson added, "you see nick fury the office guy, him going about the day-to-day work of s.h.i.e.l.d. and the politics as opposed to that other stuff. it's great to have him dealing with captain america in terms of being able to speak to him soldier to soldier and try to explain to him how the world has changed in another way while he was frozen in time. some of the people who used to be our enemies are now our allieshim trying to figure out, 'well, how do we trust those guys?' or 'how do we trust the guys that you didn't trust who don't trust you?' and explaining to him that the black and white of good guys/bad guys has now turned into this gray area." mcfeely said, "fury represents an obstacle for steve in some ways. they don't always agree on how s.h.i.e.l.d. ought to be used." the writers gave fury a more prominent role in the winter soldier, since within a plot featuring s.h.i.e.l.d. being dismantled, fury would "take the brunt of it". they also intended on depicting a character that had so far been depicted as a self-assured, commanding man as vulnerable, to enhance the sense of danger in the hydra conspiracy.additionally, toby jones, maximiliano hernndez, and garry shandling reprise their roles from previous mcu films as arnim zola, jasper sitwell, and senator stern, respectively. georges st-pierre plays georges batroc, a mercenary and a master of the french form of kickboxing known as savate. callan mulvey plays jack rollins, a member of s.h.i.e.l.d.'s s.t.r.i.k.e. unit. chin han, jenny agutter (who previously appeared in the avengers), alan dale, and bernard white appear as members of the world security council. comedic actors danny pudi and dc pierson have small roles as a s.h.i.e.l.d. technician and an apple store employee, respectively. gary sinise narrates a captain america-themed smithsonian institution exhibit, and stan lee cameos as a security guard there. winter soldier creator ed brubaker makes a cameo as a scientist working on the winter soldier. co-director joe russo cameos as a doctor, and christopher markus and stephen mcfeely cameo as two s.h.i.e.l.d. interrogators. thomas kretschmann, henry goodman, elizabeth olsen and aaron taylor-johnson appear, uncredited, as baron wolfgang von strucker, dr. list, wanda maximoff, and pietro maximoff, respectively, in the mid-credits scene.

=== development ===

in april 2011, before captain america: the first avenger was released in theaters, screenwriters christopher markus & stephen mcfeely announced that marvel had already hired the duo to work on the film's sequel. in september 2011, chris evans said that a sequel may not be released until 2014. in january 2012, neal mcdonough, who played dum dum dugan in captain america: the first avenger, mentioned that a sequel would likely be filmed after the completion of thor: the dark world, which would likely have been before the end of 2012. by march 2012, marvel whittled down the possible directors for the sequel to three candidates: george nolfi, f. gary gray, and brothers anthony and joseph russo. walt disney studios announced the planned release of the sequel to captain america: the first avenger on april 4, 2014. disney said, "the second installment will pick-up where ... the avengers leaves off, as steve rogers continues his affiliation with nick fury and s.h.i.e.l.d. and struggles to embrace his role in the modern world." markus later elaborated, "i think s.h.i.e.l.d. is the water [rogers is] swimming in. it's definitely a captain america movie. you know, if the first movie was a movie about the us army, then this is a movie about s.h.i.e.l.d... you will learn about s.h.i.e.l.d. you will learn about where it came from and where it's going and some of the cool things they have." in april, f. gary gray withdrew his name from consideration, choosing instead to direct the n.w.a biographical film straight outta compton.


==== writing ====
mcfeely said the writing began in the middle of 2011, around the release of the first avenger, with him and markus "noodling on in hopes that there would be a second one and we did a lot of just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what stuck". the first few months of writing were a back and forth process with marvel, but after an outline was finished, the story did not change much. they opted to set the story in the present day, and, after "experimenting with flashback elements for more period world war ii stuff", decided to abandon the flashbacks as "it became unwieldy." the film would be "cap versus the world we all live in today", while averting excessive comedy regarding the hero's time displacement, as markus considered the captain "the most adaptive man on the planet." the tone would be more grounded in reality despite the advanced technology to contrast the fantasy elements from both the first captain america and the avengers. despite that, the comic book origins guaranteed that the film would not have verisimilitude. this still proved a challenge in the reveal of arnim zola, that had to be extensively rewritten to convey how "this grounded espionage paranoid thriller suddenly screeches to a halt and you switch gears really quickly with this ghost in the machine" that introduces more science fiction elements.markus and mcfeely wanted to adapt ed brubaker's winter soldier storyline from the comics, which they described as "the tone of cap's modern franchise", but it took the duo six months to convince themselves that they could do it. in the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of the first avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited three days of the condor, the parallax view, and marathon man as influences, feeling it better conveyed captain america's trust issues and contrasting values in the new world he was living in, with markus saying, "if you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going to seem like a conspiracy. it's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth." three days of the condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.
the writers felt this approach was similar to how stan lee reinvented captain america in the 1960s and 1970s, with "the captain dealing with all sorts of the same things that the country [was] dealing withvietnam, watergate and all that stuffso he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." marvel studios president kevin feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, feige suggested that s.h.i.e.l.d. be brought down and have captain america fight the agency. the writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing "the physical manifestation of cap changing the world." markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. the hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as arnim zola being kept alive as a machine. feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, in our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [three days of the condor]. also the other political thrillers of the '70s: the parallax view, all the president's men. this was a time that cap existed in the comics. he found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the watergate era followed by the reagan era followed by where we are today. in the comics it was a hell of a journey for steve. and we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. but we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. and in our film that takes the form of s.h.i.e.l.d.
feige said that steve rogers would be paired with other characters from the avengers like black widow and nick fury, because unlike tony stark and thor, who could return to their own supporting casts, rogers had nowhere else to go, "and it just made sense that he was the one that stayed with what remains of the avengers at the end of the film." the writers considered including hawkeye, but "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by black widow, and joe russo added that jeremy renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. as to why the red skull from the first avenger did not appear in the winter soldier, joe russo explained, "i know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. and we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. and red skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of s.h.i.e.l.d. certainly hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. and they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." chris mckenna, who worked with the russo brothers on the sitcom community, contributed to the script by writing jokes for the film. the inclusion of the passage "ezekiel 25:17" on fury's tombstone references the character jules winnfield, from the 1994 film pulp fiction, also played by samuel l. jackson.


=== pre-production ===

by june 2012, the russo brothers entered negotiations to direct the sequel, and samuel l. jackson was confirmed to return as s.h.i.e.l.d. leader nick fury. feige sought out the russos after watching the genre-parodying season 2 finale of community which joe directed, and for the additional ideas they brought to the initial story pitch. joe russo detailed that since the intent was for a political thriller, "all the great political thrillers have very current issues in them that reflect the anxiety of the audience." thus the brothers opted to include references to drone warfare, targeted killing and global surveillance. joe even noted how during principal photography, the issues became more topical due to the disclosure of several national security agency surveillance-related documents. at the 2012 san diego comic-con international, it was announced that the official title for the sequel was captain america: the winter soldier, and that the russo brothers would direct the film. after signing on to direct, the russo brothers met with ed brubaker to learn more about where the winter soldier character came from, his thinking and the themes behind the character. in july 2012, anthony mackie entered negotiations to star as falcon alongside chris evans in the sequel. sebastian stan was also confirmed to be reprising his role as james barnes. by august 2012, anna kendrick, felicity jones, and imogen poots were being considered front-runners for a leading role in the film.in september 2012, chris evans said filming would begin in march 2013. evans also said that rogers' adjustment to the modern world, which was originally set to be included in the avengers, would be better suited for captain america: the winter soldier. at the end of the month, the greater cleveland film commission announced that captain america: the winter soldier would film in cleveland, ohio after the production was approved for a $9.5 million tax credit. producer nate moore said that after also serving as a location in the avengers, cleveland's government was helpful in providing large locations for filming, which "provided production value which we probably could not have built in a backlot." mcfeely joked that while writing ambitious action scenes "i did not realize a great american metropolis would say 'sure, shut down three miles of freeway and go to town'." portions of the film were also scheduled to be shot in california and washington, d.c.by october, emilia clarke, jessica brown findlay, teresa palmer, imogen poots, and alison brie were being considered for rogers' love interest in the film, and scarlett johansson was brought back to reprise her role as black widow. later in the month, frank grillo was testing for the role of the villain crossbones in the film, and by the end of the month, grillo closed a deal to portray the character and cobie smulders signed on to reprise her role as maria hill from the avengers.in january 2013, hayley atwell, who played peggy carter in captain america: the first avenger, said that she would not appear in the sequel. however, stanley tucci, who played dr. abraham erskine in the previous film, later said that atwell would reappear in a flashback scene. also in january, marvel studios announced that the film would be released in 3d, and anthony mackie said filming would begin on april 1, 2013. later that month, toby jones, who portrayed arnim zola in the first film, said that he would reprise the role in the sequel. by the end of the month, stages were being built for a shoot at raleigh manhattan beach studios in los angeles.in february 2013, emily vancamp entered negotiations to play a female lead in the film. by march 2013, maximiliano hernndez was signed to reprise his role as s.h.i.e.l.d. agent jasper sitwell from thor and the avengers and robert redford entered in talks to join the cast, as a high-ranking member of s.h.i.e.l.d., which he later confirmed. toward the end of march, ufc fighter georges st-pierre was cast as a character based on the comics' batroc the leaper in the film. powers boothe was asked to reprise his role from the avengers but was unable to due to working on nashville.captain america's uniform was altered from the ones seen in previous films, with a kevlar-based ballistic component that would protect captain america but at the same time function like a military uniform. joe russo said, "we wanted to use his super soldier outfit from the [steve rogers: super soldier series] as a way to represent, thematically, his place in the world of s.h.i.e.l.d. and the difference between working for s.h.i.e.l.d. and being captain america." for the falcon costume, the filmmakers were interested in adding more of a tactical design than was represented in the comic books, by including real-world webbing, straps and gear and stripping away the more comic book elements.


=== filming ===

principal photography began on april 1, 2013, at the raleigh manhattan beach studios in los angeles, under the working title freezer burn. scenes taking place on the lemurian star were filmed on the sea launch commander, docked in long beach, california. in early may, dominic cooper confirmed he would return as howard stark. on may 14, 2013, production moved to washington, d.c. with filming taking place at the national mall and the theodore roosevelt bridge. the following day, garry shandling was spotted on set reprising his iron man 2 role of senator stern. other filming locations in washington, d.c. included the willard hotel and dupont circle.filming in cleveland began on may 17 and was scheduled to last until mid-june with locations scheduled on the west shoreway, the southerly wastewater treatment plant in cuyahoga heights and the lakeview cemetery dam. cleveland was chosen as a stand-in for washington, d.c, with the city's east 6th street doubling as 7th and d streets in southwest d.c. other locations in cleveland included the federal reserve bank of cleveland, the cleveland public library, cleveland state university, the cleveland arcade, tower city center, the cleveland museum of art, and the western reserve historical society. interior shots were also filmed inside private homes and the pilgrim congregational church in tremont. filming in cleveland concluded on june 27, 2013.trent opaloch, best known for his work on district 9 and elysium, was brought in as the director of photography. opaloch said that while attempting to emulate the 1970s thrillers that served as inspiration for the writers and directors, the staging and lighting tried to bring realism through "classic framing and naturalistic lighting", and the filming was done with hand-held cameras. to achieve this, opaloch used arri alexa plus 4:3 cameras with panavision anamorphic lenses and codex digital recorders. stunt work aimed for realistic action, prioritizing practical effects. the fight scenes were staged for months, with a choreography that aimed to highlight captain america's superhuman qualities, and "move away from impressionistic action into specificity": the raid on the s.h.i.e.l.d. vessel had stealthiness as the captain knocked out enemies to avert detection, and the freeway fight with winter soldier was more "last minute" to highlight the characters' struggle to survive.in contrast to the quick editing and moving cameras of modern action films, the winter soldier aimed to feature longer action scenes that felt more visceral and dangerous. the russos mentioned the bank robbing scene of heat as a major influence, which they described as "the most intense eight minutes of filmmaking i've seen in a movie theater", and action scenes directed by brian de palma, such as the vault heist in mission: impossible, where "very likable characters are put in impossible situations that the audience is put on the edge on how they'd escape". examples of these types of scenes include the ambushes on nick fury in the street and captain america in the elevator.

additional photography was filmed in december 2013 and january 2014, in order for the russos to accurately show the state of each character after the defeat of s.h.i.e.l.d., having read the script of avengers: age of ultron to guide their choices. joss whedon, director of the avengers and avengers: age of ultron, wrote and directed the mid-credits scene, which featured wanda maximoff, pietro maximoff, and baron wolfgang von strucker. the title sequences were created by design firm sarofsky, who had worked with the russos since community. sarofsky collaborated with comic book artist david w. mack on the sequences.anthony mackie said the russo brothers relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, "the russos, what they did that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. if they can build it, they built it. if we could do it, we did it. they wanted to do as little cgi as possible. that's why the movie looks so great." nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including industrial light & magic (ilm), scanline vfx, lola vfx, luma pictures, whiskytree and the embassy, with previsualization completed by proof. the film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ilm. the film featured extensive use of digital doubles. russell earl, ilm visual effects supervisor, said, "the character that we did the most work on was falcon. we knew we were going to do cg wings. we also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. and we needed a very good digital double."lola vfx, who worked on the pre-serum steve rogers scenes in this film and captain america: the first avenger, also worked on shots featuring an elderly peggy carter. this involved digitally transposing the facial features of an elderly actress onto the face of actress hayley atwell who had performed her lines with no make-up and only a few tracking markers.the helicarriers in the film were completely digital. earl said, "in [the avengers] it was more like an aircraft carrier, now it's an aircraft carrier with the addition of battle ship-sized guns. we were all over the carriers [with the virtual camera]. we were on the decks; we were flying next to them. we had a lot of close ups and different angles. and we didn't just have one; we had three. on top of that, we had to destroy them all." this cgi environment was also used in close ups. earl said, "the challenge was to get in all of the detail to make it feel like it is a real, working ship. we created details down to the railings and all the human-scale stuff. ... for the shots in which we were destroying them, we had to have the internals as wellthe hallways, the storage areas." many of the shots of washington, d.c. were digitally created due to numerous flight restrictions in the city which necessitated that locations be recreated by computer. however, aerial footage of the city was filmed and used for live action plate photography for shots involving the triskelion, which is located on theodore roosevelt island on the potomac river.350 different versions of the film were made, to accommodate for the different formats it would be released in domestically, while also accounting for international localization and formats. the versions had to be completed in 17 days, versus a normal turnaround time of three to four weeks for contemporary films, to make its theatrical release date. one of the various changes for localization was the contents of captain america's notebook list seen at the beginning of the film. the first five items were different depending on where the film was released, while the final five items were the same across all prints. marvel held online polls allowing fans to select the items featured in each country's release.

in june 2013, henry jackman announced that he would compose the film's score. about the score jackman said, "...it's 50% production and all the tricks i've learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it's also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece". a soundtrack album was released by hollywood records on april 1, 2014.

=== critical response ===
the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reported a 90% approval rating with an average score of 7.6/10 based on 305 reviews. the website's critics consensus reads, "suspenseful and politically astute, captain america: the winter soldier is a superior entry in the avengers canon and is sure to thrill marvel diehards." metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 70 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". cinemascore audiences gave captain america: the winter soldier an "a" grade rating on an a+ to f scale.todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter said the film "takes the bold (for marvel) step of reducing cgi spectacle to a relative minimum in favor of reviving the pleasures of hard-driving old-school action, surprising character development and intriguing suspense." scott foundas of variety said it is "chockfull of the breathless cliffhangers dictated by the genre, but equally rich in the quiet, tender character moments that made the first film unique among recent marvel fare." richard roeper of the chicago sun-times considered it "another rock-solid chapter in the big-screen story of marvel," though he compared it unfavorably to the avengers, iron man and iron man 3. owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly noted the topicality of the film, and compared it to the dark knight (2008). ty burr of the boston globe said the film "delivers all the 3d cgi mayhem audiences have come to expect from the marvel entertainment juggernaut, but there's darkness and confusion just under its comic-book surface." joe morgenstern of the wall street journal praised the film's "emotional bandwidth" and nuances, and felt it fixed all the shortcomings of the first avenger "and then some".conversely, kenneth turan of the los angeles times characterized the film with a lack of inspiration. manohla dargis of the new york times said, "like many others of its type, [captain america: the winter soldier] gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up." robbie collin of the daily telegraph expressed disappointment with the lack of risks taken by the film compared to its "relatively spicy premise". mick lasalle of the san francisco chronicle felt the film was too long, with unexciting and illegible action scenes. joe williams of the st. louis post dispatch felt the winter soldier didn't explore the issues it raised and paled in comparison to the first avenger. jake coyle of the associated press said the film's biggest misstep was the handling of stan's winter soldier, and that it was "getting difficult to tell the marvel movies apart".several critics have drawn comparisons between the winter soldier and the metal gear solid video game series. gameranx compared the film to metal gear solid 2: sons of liberty (2001), stating that the first half of the winter soldier "feels like probably the closest movie adaptation we've gotten to metal gear solid 2", with similar elements including the "stealth, an evil group, cqc, and even the moral dilemma about sacrificing one's personal liberties for the feeling of security." entertainment weekly noted that the film's opening tanker mission was "rendered as a metal gear solid stealth mission". eye for film also said the opening sequence "will no doubt be familiar to anyone who's ever played metal gear solid 2".
