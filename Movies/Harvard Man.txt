== plot ==
the story concerns harvard student alan jensen, the point guard of the harvard basketball team. when his parents' house is destroyed by a tornado, alan is desperate for $100,000 to replace their home. he is approached by his girlfriend cindy bandolino, whose father is an organized crime boss. cindy convinces alan to throw a game for the money. she tells alan that her father is behind the deal, but actually she goes to her father's associate, teddy carter, and carter's assistant, kelly morgan for funding. what she does not know is that carter and morgan are undercover fbi agents.
alan throws the game, gives his parents the money, and then undergoes a psychedelic experience after he ingests a big dose of lsd, 15,000 micrograms. there follows a long stretch of the film during which morphing special effects demonstrate alan's altered state as he is pursued by carter, while cindy is collared by morgan.
just when it looks like a toss-up as to what will prove his downfall first, the bad trip, the fbi, or the mob, alan's other girlfriend (who is also his philosophy lecturer), chesney cort (played by adams), saves the day. not only does she get alan to a doctor who can bring him back to sobriety, she reveals that she is in a sexual threesome with carter and morgan. once he gets some photographic evidence for blackmail, alan is extricated from his problems.
the ending implies that he may have hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (a chronic disorder in which a person has flashbacks of visual hallucinations or distortions experienced during a previous hallucinogenic drug experience) this is also known as having acid (lsd) flashbacks. while taking a boys picture in the park the boys face morphs and alan hears echoes of past conversations when sandy said "sometimes it never ends". the little boy consoles alan telling him "everything's okay". he responds "i hope you're right". a close up is shown of his eyes dilated.
