divya pal of cnn-news18 praised the performance of diljit singh, giving it a rating of 2.5 stars out of 5 and saying, "director singh deserves credit for thinking different, aiming high to surprise viewers, but this time out, it doesn't quite come together. the reason? there is no freshness in the script. all in all, predictable plot and safe script, dilutes the impact of the film." manjusha radhakrishnan of gulf news gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5, and said, "while it's sweet at first, it gets cloyingly virtuous toward the second half. a predictable story line and stereotypical villains make it a tedious watch." the hindustan times gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5 saying, "diljit comes across as somewhat anxious in his efforts to woo audiences in his new avatar. the performance lacks the effortlessness of udta punjab. the special effects are cringe-worthy, and when diljit flies, he looks like ashok kumar marching across the army base in a comatose condition in manoj kumar's clerk." jyoti sharma bawa of the indian express praised the humour of the film saying, "diljit dosanjh film is a goofball comedy and a superhero caper all rolled into one. what it lacks in script and cgi, it more than makes up in jokes and diljit's easy charm." and gave the film a rating of 3 stars out of 5.
