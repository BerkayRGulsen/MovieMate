== reception ==
critical response to the film was generally negative, with the film receiving heavy criticism of the plot. steve "uncle creepy" barton of dread central rated the film 2/5 stars and said of the film: "there's ... some good acting, killer sound design, spooky ghost effects, and a decent amount of nudity and gore. it's a real shame all that goodness gets lost in a semi-coherent abyss of confusion."  dave murray of joblo.com rated the film 1.5/4 stars and said that it was "fun to watch once" but not a film that he could recommend.  christopher null of contactmusic.com said, "there are nuggets of what might be something worth watching in all of this, but they come through only faintly and in short bursts."
