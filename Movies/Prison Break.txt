== cast and characters ==

prison break maintains an ensemble cast for each season along with many recurring guest stars. the first season features a cast of ten actors who receive star billing, who were based in chicago or at fox river state penitentiary. the second season features a cast of nine actors who receive billing; three characters are downgraded from series regular to recurring status, another is upgraded, and a new character is introduced. the third season introduces four new characters; two of whom are prisoners at penitenciara federal de sona.most of the changes in the cast have been due to character deaths. series creator, paul scheuring, explains that killing off major characters "makes the audience that much more fearful for our protagonists" and that "it actually does help us in terms of reducing story lines". the two protagonists of the series, michael scofield and lincoln burrows, are the only characters to have appeared in every episode of the series.

dominic purcell as lincoln burrows: lincoln is a high school drop-out and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully convicted of the murder of terence steadman, the brother of the vice president of the united states. purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. he auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as tommy ravetto on north shore. since working on john doe, purcell has had an amiable relationship with fox. hence, he was sent the pilot script of prison break. scheuring's first impression of purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. however, purcell's acting won the role. he arrived on the set on the first day of filming with a shaved head, which amazed scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.
wentworth miller as michael scofield: michael is lincoln's brother (his last name is his mother's maiden name), and worked as a structural engineer before devoting full-time to his brother's case. in order to save his brother's life, michael creates an elaborate plan to help his brother escape from prison. in an interview, paul scheuring recalled that most of the actors who tested for the role "would come in playing mysterious, but it was so cheesy and false." a week before the start of production, miller auditioned for the role and impressed scheuring with his performance; he was cast the following day.
amaury nolasco as fernando sucre: sucre develops a friendship with michael during time at fox river state penitentiary, where he was his cell-mate. initially, his character's story focuses on his wish to reunite with his fiance. upon receiving the pilot script, nolasco's first thought was that it was "one of those failed pilots that the network did not really want" since most of the series pilots would have started production by that time. admitting that he does not like to read, nolasco was amazed that the script was a "huge page-turner". prior to his last audition for the role, nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when paul scheuring told him that he was their favorite choice. subsequently, he was cast in the role.
robert knepper as theodore "t-bag" bagwell: t-bag appears in all five seasons of the series as a cunning, violent, and manipulative psychopath, consistently underestimated by those around him. t-bag will stop at nothing to get what he wants and lets nothing stand in his way.

wade williams as brad bellick (seasons 14): bellick is introduced as the captain of fox river's correctional officers. after reading the pilot script, williams initially did not want to portray the role of bellick because the character was "horrible and despicable". his reluctance stemmed from being the father of a four-year-old daughter. however, his manager persuaded him to audition for the role and williams landed the role of bellick.
sarah wayne callies as sara tancredi (seasons 12, 45): sara is the prison doctor at fox river and the daughter of governor frank tancredi, who is linked into the plot that brings lincoln to fox river. she takes a liking to michael and eventually aids his escape. she ultimately joins them on the run. callies was the first actress the producers saw at the audition for the role of sara tancredi and was also the first to become a principal cast member.

== production ==


=== conception ===
the original concept of prison breaka man deliberately getting himself sent to prison in order to help someone escapewas suggested to paul scheuring by producer dawn parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. although scheuring thought it was a good idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show. he came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. in 2003, he pitched the idea to the fox broadcasting company but was turned down as fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. he subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series. prison break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of steven spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with war of the worlds. thus, the miniseries never materialized. following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as lost and 24, fox decided to back the production in 2004. the pilot episode was filmed a year after scheuring wrote the script.


=== filming ===

the first three seasons of prison break were primarily filmed outside of hollywood. the majority of the first season of the series was filmed on location in and around chicago. after it was closed down in 2002, joliet prison became the set of prison break in 2005, standing in as fox river state penitentiary on screen. scenes set in lincoln's cell, the infirmary, and the prison yard were all shot on location at the prison. lincoln's cell was alleged to be the same one in which serial killer john wayne gacy was incarcerated,b which at least one member of the production crew refused to enter, because it was alleged to be haunted. other sets were built at the prison, including the cell blocks that housed the general prison population; these blocks had three tiers of cells (as opposed to the real cell block's four) and had cells much larger than real cells to allow more space for the actors and cameras. exterior scenes were filmed in areas around chicago, woodstock, and joliet in illinois. other locations included o'hare international airport in chicago and toronto, ontario in canada. prison break spent $2 million per episode in the state of illinois, which cost them a total of $24 million in 2005.renewed for a second season, prison break resumed filming on june 15, 2006, in dallas, texas due to the close proximity of rural and urban settings. locations within a 30-minute radius of dallas were chosen which included little elm, decatur, mineral wells and mckinney. many of these locations were used to represent various american towns. the show was expected to spend in excess of $50 million in texas over the course of the second season. for the final three episodes of the second season, filming took place in pensacola, florida to represent panama. each episode took eight days to film and approximately $1.4 million went to the local economy per episode.the third season was shot in dallas and had a budget of $3 million per episode. several of the exterior scenes with lincoln and gretchen negotiating the escape from the panama jail were shot in the casco viejo quarter of panama city. the principal photography for the fourth season was relocated to los angeles, california.


=== music ===

the theme music of prison break and the incidental music of each episode was composed by ramin djawadi. the score for the first two seasons is featured in the prison break: original television soundtrack, which was released on august 28, 2007. djawadi and ferry corsten produced a remix of the theme music titled "prison break theme (ferry corsten breakout mix)" as a single, which was released by fox music in 2006. in europe, rapper faf larage's song "pas le temps" is used by television network m6 in france and by rtl-tvi in belgium to replace the show's original theme music in the title sequence, which generated publicity and helped to localize the show.


=== format ===
prison break features a serialized story structure, similar to that of its first season companion show 24. at the 2009 tv critics press tour, kevin reilly told reporters that the series would end with the fourth season. despite decreasing ratings, reilly attributed the cancellation to creativity. he stated, "the show has just played out. you get to a point creatively where you feel all the stories have been told, and you want to end strong and not gimp out in the end of the season." regarding the finale, reilly stated, "they have a really cool ending, actually. i know where they end, and it's a hell of an idea."


=== tattoo ===
designed by tom berg and created by tinsley transfers, the tattoo took around five hours to be applied onto wentworth miller. in scenes where the actor is wearing a t-shirt and the entire tattoo isn't being shown, only the forearm pieces of the tattoo were applied.

=== critical response ===
the show debuted on august 29, 2005 to an estimated audience of 10.5 million viewers. fox had not seen such success for summertime monday numbers since melrose place and ally mcbeal aired in september 1998. the premiere was ranked first in both the 1849 and 1834 demographics. the strong debut performance was also matched by various positive reviews. according to the new york times, prison break was "more intriguing than most of the new network series, and it certainly is one of the most original", complimenting its ability to create a "suspenseful thriller" and its "authentic look". gillian flynn of entertainment weekly dubbed it as one of the best new shows of 2005. on the other hand, the washington post criticized the show for its "somber pretentiousness" and "uniformly overwrought" performances. due to its ratings success, fox decided to extend prison break by an extra nine episodes, making it the first new series in the 20052006 television season to receive a full season order of 22 episodes. the series averaged 9.2 million viewers per week in its first season.the premiere of the second season of prison break obtained an average of 9.4 million viewers. the decline was steeper among young-adult viewers with a decrease of 20% in the 1849 demographic compared to its series premiere, but its household rating grew from 3.6% to 3.9% during the last half-hour. robert bianco of usa today commented on the "harebrained absurdities that have swamped this show", and blamed the writers for being "incredibly lazy" for the continuous use of the tattoo as an "all-purpose plot fix". in contrast, detroit free press commended the second-season premiere on matching the standard set by the first season, which delivered "rocking good entertainment" due to its "motley crew of cellblock characters" and the "taut, ingenious storytelling of series creator paul t. scheuring and his staff." the second season obtained its largest audience on the original airdate of the episode, "chicago" with an average of 10.1 million viewers. overall, the second season averaged 9.3 million viewers per week.the third and particularly fourth season received progressively more negative reviews, as the show's plot diverged from its origin story of breaking out of prison, and focused more on conventional elements of a government conspiracy drama series.season five received mixed reviews. on review aggregator rotten tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 52% based on 21 reviews, with an average score of 6.61/10. the site's critical consensus reads, "prison break recaptures some of its old urgency in its return, but familiar faces and frenetic action aren't enough to make up for a plot that manages to bore while beggaring belief." on metacritic, the season has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".


=== classification ===
concerns were raised by the parents television council in the united states about the time slot in which prison break was broadcast (8:00 pm et) since the show features some scenes which contain graphic content. in france, the broadcasting watchdog, conseil suprieur de l'audiovisuel (csa), also complained that the violence in some episodes exceeded the amount allowed for its rating, which is "not for under 10s". under france's regulations, any higher ratings would move the show away from its current primetime timeslot to a later timeslot. however, their decision to change the rating would only affect the first season, which has already been broadcast, and not the second season.
