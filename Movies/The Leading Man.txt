a leading man is a complimentary term for the actor who is the primary male protagonist in a film, television show, or play, usually the main character who can be an action hero or any sort of man, often including a love interest to the leading lady. a leading man is sometimes an all-rounder; capable of being comical and/or heroic, singing, dancing, and acting at a professional level.
a leading man can also be an actor who is often seen in romantic roles. an example of this would be bruce cabot's role playing against fay wray in king kong. less frequently, the term has been applied to an actor who is often associated with one particular actress; for example, spencer tracy had a similar association with both katharine hepburn and joan bennett, and gable made numerous major films with joan crawford, myrna loy, or jean harlow. the term is also used collectively, as in "hollywood's leading men" to refer to a group of notable, famous, or popular actors.
