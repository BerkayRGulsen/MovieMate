== plot ==
jason "igby" slocumb, jr. (kieran culkin) is a misanthropic 17-year-old boy, rebelling against the oppressive world of his strict east coast "old money" family. his schizophrenic father, jason (bill pullman), has been committed to an institution. igby fears that he will eventually suffer a mental breakdown like his father. his mother, mimi (susan sarandon), is self-absorbed and distant and has a tendency to drink heavily. igby mockingly describes his ambitious older brother ollie (ryan phillippe) as a fascist or, alternatively, a young republican, and that he studies "neo-fascism" (economics) at columbia university.
igby figures that there must be a better life out there, and he sets out to find it, rebelling against his family at every opportunity. after happily flunking out of several prep schools, he ends up in a brutal military academy where he gets beaten by his classmates. after escaping and spending time in a chicago hotel courtesy of his mother's credit card, igby is sent to new york for the summer to his godfather, successful real estate magnate d.h. banes (jeff goldblum).
while working construction for d.h., igby first encounters rachel (amanda peet), his godfather's heroin-addicted trophy mistress. rather than return to school, he escapes into the bohemian underworld of manhattan, hiding out with rachel and her performance artist friend russel (jared harris). eventually, he and rachel have sex. after being suspected and beaten up by d.h. because of it, he then hooks up with terminally bored, part-time lover, sookie (claire danes), only for her to later leave him for ollie.
despite seeming cold and distant, mimi is not unaffected by her rebellious son. she describes igby's conception as an act of animosity and therefore believes that it shouldn't be a surprise that his life follows the same course. his name is explained as a family in-joke. as a child, he would blame his toy bear, digby, for things he had done only he was mispronouncing it as "igby". in order to get him to take responsibility for his actions, his family would call him igby whenever he lied.
igby is informed by d.h. that his mother mimi is dying from breast cancer and so he returns to see her. she has arranged to commit suicide with help from ollie, who feeds her poisoned strawberry yogurt before ultimately placing a plastic bag over her head.
before she dies, mimi makes a final revelation, casually inquiring of igby, "i take it you know that d.h. is your father?" igby visits his father in the hospital before leaving for los angeles to finally make a clean break by getting 3,000 miles away from his family.
