== production ==
the film had originally been slated to be directed by silvio narizzano, although he left the production and almond was brought in. production was further complicated when the soviet government refused almond's request for stock film footage of moscow and leningrad, due to its displeasure at canada's diplomatic response to the 1979 sovietafghan war.dewhurst described her experience working on the film as "summer stock in podunk". she clarified that "the crew was terrific. the hierarchy was at fault. i keep praying that it will never come out. i have no comment about mr. almond and you can write that down. you will never see four more confused actors on the screen in your life."


== critical response ==
in his 2003 book a century of canadian cinema, film scholar gerald pratley trashed the film, calling it "probably the worst spy movie ever made".
