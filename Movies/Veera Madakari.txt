== production ==
actor-director sudeep is well known for making successful remakes, especially from telugu language box-office hits. sudeep in the film casts himself in two different roles and has also given his voice to some songs. the film, as a remake of vikramarkudu, successfully maintains the original script of its telugu counterpart.


== soundtrack ==
the film has 6 songs.


== review ==
the reviews of the film are favorable regarding the rendition of songs, choreography and the dual role of the protagonist but the film suffers because of its long duration and its sluggish pace in the first half of the movie. sudeep excels more as an actor rather than a film director. ragini as a debutante is imposing. sudeep does justice to his dual role, so does tennis krishna. dharma is impressive in the sentimental role. camera work and the action scenes of the movie are worth commenting.
