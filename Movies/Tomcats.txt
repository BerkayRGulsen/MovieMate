michael realizes that kyle (jake busey) and him are now the last men standing and stand to inherit the entire fund, which has swelled to an enormous amount. he approaches kyle and learns that the latter is wealthy and a jerk. he decides that his only option is to set kyle up so that michael can inherit the fund. he learns on a drunken night that kyle has only ever loved one woman, a lady named natalie (shannon elizabeth), whom he met at steve and tricia's (jaime pressly) wedding.
michael approaches steve and tricia and finds out where natalie is. unfortunately, they neglect to tell him that natalie is a police detective. natalie is working undercover as a streetwalker when michael finds her and he inadvertently gets himself arrested for solicitation. during interrogation, he admits everything and is eventually released.
natalie visits him and agrees to go in with his plan on the basis that she gets half the money. he finds out that kyle's memory of natalie and his night together left out some important details, notably when natalie woke up kyle had bolted, leaving her with a bag of quarters to get a cab home.

michael goes on to claim the fund and thereby settles his debt with carlos. he later bumps into kyle who is on a date with another woman and punches him as he believes kyle to be cheating on natalie. kyle beats up michael and then discloses that he has split with natalie. on their wedding night, she knocked him unconscious and when he woke up, he found a bag of quarters. michael runs off to find natalie and finds her again working undercover. he proposes that they date and he gives up his tomcat ways.
