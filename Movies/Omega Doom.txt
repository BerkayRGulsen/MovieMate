at the end of a world war between humans and robots, a nuclear bomb was detonated and a dark age begun, without technology or electricity. on the last day of the war, as the nuclear bombs are detonating, one of the robots, omega doom, is shot in his head by a dying soldier. the shot causes doom's programming for the destruction of mankind to be erased. after the world was cleared of humanity by the cyborgs, only the cyborgs and robots remain. some time later, omega doom arrives at a destroyed city, where he encounters an unusual community of robots and roms (newer and more advanced robots), who are in conflict.
at the city omega doom finds there are two remaining peaceful robots - a former nanny who now works as a bartender and the head of a former teacher, whom the other robots use as a ball. omega doom helps the head find a body and tells doom about a rumored stock of hidden weapons. both the robots and the roms want these weapons in order to continue the destruction of the remaining humans.
eventually, omega doom gets the robots to promise to destroy the roms in exchange for half of the weapons; but he also proposes the same deal to the roms. the robots and the roms end up fighting each other, ensuring their mutual destruction. afterwards, doom leaves the last two peaceful robots (the bartender and the head) and the one remaining rom in charge of the city and doom continues his wandering.
