"evangelion: the new movie: prelude") is a 2007 japanese animated science fiction action film, the first of the tetralogy evangelion, written and chief directed by hideaki anno. it is the first of four films released in the rebuild of evangelion tetralogy based on the original anime series neon genesis evangelion. it was produced and co-distributed by anno's studio khara in partnership with gainax. hideaki anno wrote the first movie and is the general director and manager for the entire project. yoshiyuki sadamoto provided character designs for the film, while ikuto yamashita provided mechanical designs. both shinji higuchi and tomoki kyoda provided the film's storyboards.
the film focuses on a young teenager named shinji ikari, who finds he must pilot a mecha known as "evangelion unit-01" to protect the world from mysterious creatures known as angels. the plot is largely a point-for-point adaptation of the first six episodes of the original anime. while some scenes and events are replications of the original series, others unfold differently with new or omitted scenes and newly-available 3d cg technology. the film received a positive response from fans, with hideaki anno himself calling it a "faithful remake of the original series". the film was ranked as the 4th-highest grossing anime film at the japanese box office during 2007, earning a total of over $20 million worldwide.


== plot ==
in 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the second impact, the child shinji ikari is summoned to tokyo-3 by his estranged father gendo, the commander of the paramilitary organization nerv. shinji is caught in the crossfire between un forces and an angel, an alien lifeform; captain misato katsuragi rescues him and brings him to nerv headquarters. gendo demands shinji pilot evangelion unit 01, a giant bio-machine, against the angel. shinji concedes when gendo has rei ayanami, a wounded evangelion pilot, prepared to be sent out instead. shinji becomes unconscious during the fight due to the injuries inflicted by the angel on unit 01, because evangelions sympathetically reflect the pain of the injuries it sustains onto the pilot. unit 01 autonomously reactivates and wins the fight, after it goes berserk and destroys the angel. gendo informs his superiors at the enigmatic cabal seele that the "human instrumentality project" is proceeding as planned.
misato becomes shinji's guardian and he is enrolled in a local middle school. when another angel arrives, shinji's classmates toji suzuhara and kensuke aida sneak out of their emergency shelter to watch the battle, but the angel throws unit 01 onto a mountainside, nearly crushing them. misato has the two take cover in unit 01's cockpit and orders shinji to retreat, but he ignores it and destroys the angel with unit 01's knife. after misato scolds him for insubordination, shinji wanders off, and is recovered by nerv agents and brought back to her.
the sixth angel appears, but when shinji goes to attack it in unit 01, the angel fires a powerful laser, critically injuring him, then begins drilling into tokyo-3 to reach nerv headquarters. he wakes from a coma several hours later and rei tells him she will take his place and leaves for the mission alone.
to motivate the despondent shinji, misato takes him to the deepest level of nerv headquarters and shows him a giant white being crucified to a cross-like restraint: the second angel, lilith. misato explains the angels are attempting to initiate contact with lilith and bring about the third impact, the prophesized end of all life on earth.
shinji agrees to pilot unit 01 against the angel alongside rei in unit 00. he successfully destroys it with an experimental positron sniper rifle, which requires the entire electrical power output of japan to power. rei is nearly killed defending shinji from the angel's return fire, but he saves her by cooling unit 00 in water and prying open its cockpit using unit 01's knife. rei, normally cold and emotionless, shares a smile with him.
on the surface of the moon, kaworu nagisa awakens from one of nine coffin-like containers arranged on the surface. in a pit in front of him, surrounded by construction equipment and scaffolding, is an unidentified giant, wearing a purple seven-eyed mask and wrapped in white bandages. a black monolith appears, through which he and seele 01 engage in a cryptic conversation. looking towards earth, kaworu says that "the third one" has not changed at all and that he looks forward to meeting shinji.
