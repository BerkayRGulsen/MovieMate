ali is a 2001 american biographical sports drama film co-written, produced and directed by michael mann. the film focuses on ten years in the life of the boxer muhammad ali, played by will smith, from 1964 to 1974, featuring his capture of the heavyweight title from sonny liston, his conversion to islam, criticism of the vietnam war, and banishment from boxing, his return to fight joe frazier in 1971, and, finally, his reclaiming the title from george foreman in the rumble in the jungle fight of 1974. it also touches on the great social and political upheaval in the united states following the assassinations of malcolm x and martin luther king jr.
the film was well received by critics, but was a box-office bomb. will smith and jon voight received academy award nominations for best actor and best supporting actor, respectively.


== plot ==
the film begins with cassius clay jr. before his championship debut against then-heavyweight champion sonny liston. clay taunts liston, then dominates the early rounds of the match. halfway through, he complains of a burning feeling in his eyes (implying that liston has tried to cheat) and says he is unable to continue. however, his trainer/manager angelo dundee gets him to keep fighting. once clay is able to see again, he dominates the fight and liston quits before round seven, making clay the second-youngest heavyweight champion at the time after floyd patterson.
clay spends time with malcolm x, then is invited to the home of nation of islam leader elijah muhammad, where he is granted the name muhammad ali. his father, cassius clay sr. disapproves of this. ali marries sonji roi, an ex-playboy bunny, although she is not muslim and does not abide sex segregation. ali goes to africa and meets up with malcolm x, but later refuses to speak to him, honoring the wishes of elijah muhammad. he is extremely distraught when x is later assassinated.
upon returning to america, ali goes against sonny liston a second time and knocks him out in the first round. he and sonji divorce after she objects to various obligations muslim women have.ali refuses conscription for the vietnam war and is stripped of his boxing license, passport and title, and sentenced to five years in prison. ali marries 17-year-old belinda boyd. after a three-year hiatus, his conviction is overturned and in his comeback fight, he goes against jerry quarry and wins by technical knockout in three rounds.
ali attempts to regain the heavyweight championship against joe frazier. in the "fight of the century", frazier generally has the upper hand against ali and wins by decision, the first loss of ali's career. frazier later loses the championship to george foreman.
foreman and ali go to kinshasa, zaire, for the rumble in the jungle fight. there ali meets veronica porch and has an affair with her. after reading rumors of his infidelity through newspapers, his wife belinda travels to zaire to confront him about this. ali says he is unsure as to whether he really loves veronica or not, and just wants to focus on his upcoming title shot.
for a good portion of the fight against foreman, ali leans back against the ropes, allowing foreman to tire himself out. then he knocks out the tired foreman, regaining the heavyweight championship.

== production ==
the project began in 1992 when producer paul ardaji optioned the movie rights to muhammad ali's life story. in 1992, ardaji had visited ali on his 50th birthday and persuaded him to allow a film to be made about his life. nearing the end of his option period, ardaji signed a contract with sony pictures, joining forces with producer jon peters as producing partner. producer jon peters started developing the film in 1994. gregory allen howard wrote the initial draft of the script, which had the working title power and grace. howard's draft focused on ali's life from 12 to 40 years old, and his relationship with his father. howard was replaced by writers stephen j. rivele and chris wilkinson, and by 1998 the biopic was set up at columbia pictures, with will smith attached to star and the possibility of ron howard directing. during the filming of wild wild west, smith presented director barry sonnenfeld with the script. columbia was hoping for filming to start towards the end of 1998, but it was pushed back, and sonnenfeld exited in november 1999. it was speculated the columbia was hesitant to move forward with sonnenfeld following the disappointing box office performance of wild wild west. in february 2000, it was announced that michael mann had taken over as director, following his academy award nomination for the insider. with this commitment to ali, mann turned down the opportunity to direct early versions of the aviator, shooter and savages, and brought eric roth to co-write the script. after years of being attached to the ali biopic, smith officially signed on in may 2000 with a $20 million salary.filming began in los angeles on january 11, 2001 on a $105 million budget. shooting also took place in new york city, chicago, miami and mozambique.smith spent about one year learning about ali's life. these included boxing training (up to seven hours a day), islamic studies with wiljah akbar and dialect training. smith has said that his portrayal of ali is his proudest work to date.one of the selling points of the film is the realism of the fight scenes. smith worked alongside boxing promoter guy sharpe from sharpeshooter entertainment, and his lead fighter ross kent, to get the majority of his boxing tips for the film. all of the boxers in the film are former or current world heavyweight championship caliber boxers. it was quickly decided that 'hollywood fighting'passing the fist (or foot) between the camera and the face to create the illusion of a hitwould not be used in favor of actual boxing. the only limitation placed upon the fighters was for charles shufford (who plays george foreman). he was permitted to hit smith as hard as he could, so long as he did not actually knock the actor out.
smith had to gain weight to look the part of muhammad ali.

=== critical response ===
