== plot ==
loosely based on the real-life actor-manager geoffrey kendal's family and his travelling "shakespeareana company", which earned him the indian sobriquet "shakespearewallah", the film follows the story of nomadic british actors as they perform shakespeare plays in towns in post-colonial india. in this story, tony buckingham (geoffrey kendal) and his wife carla (laura liddell) oversee the troupe. their daughter, lizzie buckingham (felicity kendal), falls in love with sanju (shashi kapoor), who is also romancing manjula (madhur jaffrey), a bollywood film star.
in real life, shashi kapoor fell in love with felicity's elder sister jennifer kendal. their marriage provided an important contribution to the indian film industry until kendal's death in 1984.
