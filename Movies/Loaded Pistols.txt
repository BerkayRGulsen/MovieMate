following the death of his friend ed norton who was killed during a dice game, gene autry (gene autry) sets out in search of the killer. his search takes him to an old house where larry evans (russell arms), who was accused of the murder, is in hiding. larry's sister mary (barbara britton) defends her brother, claiming they both loved ed, who acted as their guardian after the death of their father. mary is able to convince gene that larry is innocent. gene offers to help him evade the sheriff until he can discover the real killer.
later, gene discovers that larry's gun, which was used in the killing, was offered as collateral during the dice game, and anyone could have taken it and shot ed when the lights in the room went out. to allude a posse, gene takes larry to a cabin belonging to his prospector friend, jim hedge (clem bevans). when gene questions him about the game, larry tells him that either dave randall (jack holt) or don mason (robert shayne), who were both playing in the game, suggested that he put up the gun. gene rides back into town to continue his search for the real killer.
