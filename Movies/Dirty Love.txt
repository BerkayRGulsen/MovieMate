=== critical response ===
the film received extremely negative reviews from critics. on review aggregation website rotten tomatoes, it has a rating of 7% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 2.2/10. the site's consensus states: "the laugh-free dirty love is a comedy dead zone -- it's aggressively crude and shoddily constructed." metacritic reports a 9 out of 100 rating, based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating "overwhelming dislike".film critic roger ebert of the chicago sun-times gave a rare zero star rating and said it was the third-worst film of 2005. in his written review, he stated, "here is a film so pitiful, it doesn't rise to the level of badness. it is hopelessly incompetent."not all reviews were negative. oz of efilmcritic gave the film 3/5 and said "dirty love is a surprisingly good effort that will fall short only because of poor direction, poor editing, and the stigma of the lead having only previously been involved in crap." 
jeremy c. fox of pajiba said that although the film is not for everyone, "dirty love is in the worst possible taste. it has crossed the himalayas of bad taste and come out the other side. and for that reason, if no other, i kinda love it." he concludes, "the response to dirty love says less about the movie than it does the bullying, herd-following nature of most movie critics."
