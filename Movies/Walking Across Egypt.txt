== reception ==
robert koehler from variety said of the film, "the best in forgiving christian values is at the heart of well-intentioned but weakly conceived walking across egypt. by far, the most distinguishing factor is ellen burstyn's independent-minded southern widower mattie,[...] but that won't be enough to stop this from going directly to family-oriented cable." despite this, the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes has given it an 89% according to audience ratings.
