== production ==
wings of courage was the first imax 3-d short film created to be projected on the world's largest screens, with a process that uses a wider film gauge, more intense light and a brighter screen (covered with five coats of silver). the 3-d glasses were also a new type, liquid crystal lenses that are controlled by radio waves with each lens blinking 48 times a second, in sync with the projected image.


== reception ==
for roger ebert', wings of courage is "... a technical, rather than an artistic achievement." in the review in the new york times, caryn james had a similar evaluation: "'wings of courage' is a swooping, old-fashioned adventure tale that uses flashy newfangled technology. the first fiction movie made for imax 3-d (the format that makes everyone wear oversized, goofy-looking goggles), this 40-minute film plays to the strengths of its 3-d technique. it's a winning ploy. film critic leonard maltin considered wings of courage, "beautiful scenery aside, this is a lumbering, boring true-life adventure ... dramatically speaking, it's about as lively as a 1930s monogram programmer.
