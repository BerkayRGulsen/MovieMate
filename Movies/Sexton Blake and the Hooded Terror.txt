== critical reception ==
of the film's villain, leonard maltin concluded, "slaughter plays it basically straight in this passable low-budget outing"; while dennis schwartz wrote, "tod slaughter is a trip as the perverse villain drooling over both stamps and julie (greta gynt), and decked out when meeting gang members in a spiffy black robe with a snake embroidered on its front and a fashionable kkk-like hood. like vincent price, slaughter can make a not too original low-budget b film fun to watch."
