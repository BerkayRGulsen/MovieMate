the film is about the residents of pebbles court in the melbourne suburb of homesville who are the unknowing test subjects for a new variety of "vimuville" dietary supplement pills that arrive for free in their mailboxes. the pills are designed to produce the ultimate healthy human, but have unexpected side effects including hallucinations and mutations. despite the attempts made to warn the townsfolk from a previous test subject, who is now undergoing rapid cellular decay, he arrives too late, and crashes his car and is killed by tentacles growing out of his throat. the pills are consumed by the residents, and produce liquefying flesh, elongated tongues, exploding stomachs, exploding penises, imploding heads, monstrous births, tentacles growing out of the face, living mucus, sentient placentas, and other gruesome mutations. ultimately more and more of the residents of the pebbles court mutate or die horrific deaths, until almost every character has been dispatched.
