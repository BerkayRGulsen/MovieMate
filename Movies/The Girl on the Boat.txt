== critical reception ==
sky movies: "something of a departure for norman wisdom...wisdom was not to stray from formula again until the conclusion of his string of crazy comedies for rank". the radio times comments: "norman wisdom tried something different from his usual slapstick with this seagoing comedy romance ...it doesn't work for wisdom, though it does for the less mannered professionals in support such as richard briers, millicent martin and athene seyler". allmovie: "like jerry lewis, norman wisdom is an acquired taste, but he's worth sampling at least once".
