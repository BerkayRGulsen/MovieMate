riddled with guilt over the loss of his rock star older brother, 16-year-old david forrester (ricky ullman) becomes obsessed with death, leading his misguided parents to send him to driftwood, an "attitude adjustment camp for troubled youths" run by the sadistic captain doug kennedy (diamond dallas page) and his brutal young henchman, yates (talan torriero). once there, david becomes haunted by the spirit of jonathan (connor ross), a former inmate who met a mysterious end; a mystery whose resolution could very well be david's only way out.
