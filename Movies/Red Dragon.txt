== plot ==
in 1980, fbi agent will graham visits forensic psychiatrist hannibal lecter to discuss a case. graham has been working with lecter on a psychological profile of a serial killer who removes edible body parts from his victims; graham says he has realized the killer is a cannibal. realizing graham is close to discovering he is the killer, lecter stabs him, but graham fights back, stabbing and shooting lecter before they both fall unconscious. lecter is imprisoned in an institution for the criminally insane, and graham, traumatized, retires to florida with his family.
years later, another serial killer, nicknamed the tooth fairy, has killed two families during full moons. with another full moon approaching, special agent jack crawford persuades graham to help develop the killer's profile. after visiting the crime scenes and speaking with crawford, graham concludes that he must consult lecter. lecter taunts graham, but agrees to help.

the tooth fairy is francis dolarhyde, who kills as directed by his alternate personality, which he calls the great red dragon, named after the william blake painting the great red dragon and the woman clothed in sun, which he has tattooed on his back. he believes that each victim brings him closer to becoming the dragon, as his psychopathology originates from his childhood abuse by his grandmother.
freddy lounds, a tabloid reporter for the national tattler who hounded graham after lecter's capture, pursues graham for leads on the tooth fairy. a letter from the tooth fairy is discovered hidden in lecter's cell, expressing admiration for lecter and an interest in graham, and suggesting that lecter reply through the personals section of the tattler, which he does with graham's home address, forcing graham's wife molly and son josh to relocate.
hoping to lure out the tooth fairy, graham interviews lounds, who disparages the killer as an impotent homosexual. an enraged dolarhyde kidnaps lounds, glues him to an antique wheelchair, forces him to recant his allegations on tape, and then bites off his lips and sets him on fire outside the tattler offices. at his job in a st. louis photo lab, dolarhyde gives reba mcclane, a blind co-worker, a ride to her home and they begin a relationship. however, his alternate personality demands that he kill her. desperate to stop the dragon's control over him, dolarhyde goes to the brooklyn museum, tears apart the blake painting, and eats it.
graham realises that the tooth fairy knew the layout of his victims' houses from their home videos. he deduces that he works for the company that edits the home movies and transfers them to video. he visits the company processing plant to ask for information, and is spotted by dolarhyde as he returns from brooklyn. 
dolarhyde goes to reba's house. she has spent the evening with a co-worker, ralph mandy. dolarhyde kills ralph, kidnaps reba, takes her to his house, and sets it ablaze. unable to shoot her, dolarhyde apparently shoots himself. reba escapes as the police arrive. dolarhyde, having used ralph's corpse to stage his death, infiltrates graham's home in florida and takes josh hostage, threatening to kill him. to save josh, graham loudly insults him, reminding dolarhyde of his grandmother's abuse and provoking him to furiously attack graham. both are severely wounded in a shootout, which ends when molly kills dolarhyde. 
graham survives and receives a letter from lecter praising his work and bidding him well. lecter's jailer, dr. frederick chilton, tells him that he has a visitor, a young woman from the fbi.

== production ==
the 1991 film the silence of the lambs, starring anthony hopkins as lecter, was a critical and commercial success, winning five academy awards. hopkins was the only major member of the silence of the lambs team to return for the 2001 sequel, hannibal; it was also a commercial success, but received less positive reviews. both films were adapted from novels by thomas harris.husband-and-wife producers dino and martha de laurentiis decided to produce a film based on the 1981 novel red dragon, the first hannibal lecter novel, as a prequel to the silence of the lambs. dino said that everyone felt he was "crazy" for adapting the book, as it had been previously adapted as manhunter (1986), with brian cox as lecter. both manhunter and red dragon had the same cinematographer, dante spinotti.hopkins hesitated to sign on, worried that three lecter films might be too much. screenwriter ted tally, who wrote the silence of the lambs but not hannibal, had turned down many offers to write more serial killer stories. he said he liked the idea of hopkins' lecter films forming a trilogy: "if it ends here, it will end gracefully. i would hate to see this become hannibal lecter xiii." to satisfy expectations, tally added lecter scenes not in the novel, describing it as a "commercial reality". he had the support of harris, who sent tally dialogue and ideas for scenes. edward norton and ralph fiennes admired the silence of the lambs but had not enjoyed hannibal. the cast were persuaded to join by tally's screenplay; fiennes felt it worked "only on suspense", without overt violence.norton and ratner disagreed on the scene in which graham approaches the incarcerated lecter for the first time. ratner wanted norton to incorporate a gesture or look to indicate graham's fear, but norton felt the audience would not need this if it were filmed correctly. they compromised by showing graham's sweat stains when he removes his jacket in the next scene. whereas fiennes wanted to avoid overplaying his serial killer character, hopkins aimed to play lecter with more "danger and rage" than before. fiennes spent 90 minutes of each day for months building his physique, and wore a prosthetic to give him a cleft palate. the tattoo on his back took around eight hours to apply.
