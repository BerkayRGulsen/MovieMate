in rome, the group heads to vatican city, where mieke is touring before her summer at sea. inside the vatican, scotty and cooper search for mieke and accidentally ring the bell that signals the pope has died. scotty appears on a balcony and spots mieke in the cheering crowd below, who have mistaken him for the newly elected pope. the swiss guards detains scotty and cooper for their actions, but they are rescued by the manchester united hooligans from london. scotty finally introduces himself to mieke and confesses his love. mieke is happy to see him, and they have sex in a confessional booth before she leaves on her trip. on the flight back to ohio, jenny and cooper give into their urges and have sex in the plane's lavatory, while jamie stays in europe after being hired by arthur frommer. 
scotty moves to oberlin college in the fall term. during his phone conversation with cooper, who is now dating jenny, mieke knocks on the door of his room, having been assigned to the same room because of another misunderstanding about her name. scotty and mieke embrace and get into bed together, with cooper calling for scott on the other end of a still-open cell phone call and the film closing with the absinthe green fairy wondering at his own lack of a sex life.


== cast ==
