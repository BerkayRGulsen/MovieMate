== roy orbison version ==
roy orbison covered "love hurts" in 1961 and issued it as the b-side to "running scared." while "running scared" was an international hit, the b-side only picked up significant airplay in australia. consequently, chart figures for australia show "running scared"/"love hurts" as a double a-side, both sides peaking at no. 5. this makes orbison's recording of "love hurts" the first version to be a hit.


== jim capaldi version ==
jim capaldi reached number 4 in the uk charts with his interpretation of "love hurts" in november 1975, which was to prove his highest charting uk single. described by rolling stone as having "a sense of pain very different from roy orbison's." the single also charted in the us, germany, and sweden.
