== critical reception ==
in contemporary reviews, picturegoer weekly wrote, "jerry verno is an efficient and funny comedian...what laughter there is is easily accounted for but the scenes that are supposed to be thrilling miss the mark"; kine weekly wrote, "comedy and thrills are adequately blended in a somewhat far-fetched crook story. acting is quite good, presentation fair. a light second feature, of which cheeriness is the keynote, is indicated"; and the bioscope wrote, "here is one of those unostentatiously produced british pot-boilers, made with an eye on the cash-box, which may be expected to hold its own in the family house, chiefly as a second feature. its light comedy and mystery atmosphere will get it past an unsophisticated audience."
