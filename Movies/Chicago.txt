== plot ==
in 1924, roxie hart watches lead role velma kelly perform ("overture/all that jazz") at a chicago theater. wanting stardom for herself, she begins an affair with fred casely, who claims to know the manager. after the show, velma is arrested for killing her husband charlie and sister veronica, after finding them in bed together.
a month later, casely admits to roxie that he has no showbiz connections and just wanted to sleep with her. enraged, she shoots him dead. she convinces her husband, amos, to take the blame, telling him she killed a burglar in self-defense. as amos confesses to the detective, roxie fantasizes that she is singing a song devoted to her husband ("funny honey"). however, when the detective brings up evidence that roxie and casely were having an affair, amos recants; roxie furiously admits what really happened and is arrested. ambitious district attorney harrison announces he will seek the death penalty.
at cook county jail, roxie is sent to murderess' row, under the care of the corrupt matron "mama" morton ("when you're good to mama"). roxie meets her idol velma, but her friendship is rudely rebuffed. she learns the backstories of the other women there, including velma ("cell block tango"). on morton's advice, roxie engages velma's lawyer, the brilliant billy flynn ("all i care about"). flynn and roxie manipulate the press, reinventing roxie's identity as an originally virtuous woman turned bad by the fast life of the city; she claims she had the affair with casely because amos was always working, but repented and dumped him for amos, and casely jealously attacked her ("we both reached for the gun"). the press believe the story; praised by the public as a tragic heroine, roxie becomes an overnight sensation ("roxie"). velma, unhappy at losing the public's attention, tries to convince roxie to join her act, replacing the sister that she murdered ("i can't do it alone"), but roxie, now the more popular of the two rivals, snubs her just as velma originally snubbed roxie.
meanwhile, kitty "go-to-hell kitty" baxter, a wealthy heiress, is arrested for murdering her husband and his two lovers, and the press and flynn pay more attention to her. to velma's surprise, roxie quickly steals back the fame by claiming to be pregnant. amos is ignored by the press ("mister cellophane"), and flynn, to create more sympathy for roxie, convinces him that the child is casely's, and that he should divorce roxie in the middle of her predicament. roxie over-confidently fires flynn, believing she can now win on her own. however, when katalin helinszki, a hungarian woman on murderess' row (who happens to be the only inmate to protest and insist on her own innocence), becomes the first woman in cook county history to be executed by hanging, roxie realizes the gravity of the situation and rehires flynn.
roxie's trial begins, and billy turns it into a media spectacle ("razzle dazzle") with the help of the sensationalist newspaper reporters and radio personality mary sunshine. billy discredits witnesses, manipulates evidence, and even stages a public reconciliation between amos and roxie when she says the child is his. the trial seems to be going roxie's way until velma appears with roxie's diary: she reads incriminating entries in exchange for amnesty in her own case. billy discredits the diary, implying that harrison was the one who planted the evidence ("a tap dance"). roxie is acquitted, but her fame is eclipsed moments later when another woman, who had also shot her own husband, shoots her lawyer just outside the courthouse. flynn tells her to accept it, and admits that he tampered with her diary himself, in order to incriminate the district attorney and also free two clients at once. amos remains loyal and excited to be a father, but roxie cruelly rejects him, revealing that she is not pregnant, and he finally leaves her.
roxie does become a vaudeville performer, but is very unsuccessful ("nowadays"). velma is just as unsuccessful, and again approaches roxie to suggest performing together: a double act consisting of two murderers. roxie initially refuses, but later accepts when velma points out that they can perform together despite their resentment for each other. the two stage a spectacular performance that earns them the love of the audience and the press ("nowadays / hot honey rag"). the film concludes with roxie and velma receiving a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience (which includes flynn, morton, the jurors and other acquitted murderesses), and proclaiming that, "we couldn't have done it without you".

== production ==


=== development ===
the film is based on the 1975 broadway musical, which ran for 936 performances but was not well received by audiences, primarily due to the show's cynical tone. a film version of chicago was to have been the next project for bob fosse, who had directed and choreographed the original 1975 broadway production and had won an oscar for his direction of the film version of cabaret (1972). it was set to star goldie hawn as roxie and liza minnelli as velma kelly. although he died before realizing his version, fosse's distinctive jazz choreography style is evident throughout the 2002 film, and he is thanked in the credits. the minimalist 1996 revival of the musical proved far more successful, having played more than 9,562 performances (as of november 17, 2019), holding records for longest-running musical revival, longest-running american musical on broadway, and second longest-running show in broadway history. its runaway success sparked a greater appreciation of the 1975 original production and renewed stalled interest in a long-anticipated film adaptation, which incorporates the influences of both productions.the original production's musical numbers were staged as vaudeville acts; the film respects this but presents them as cutaway scenes in the mind of the roxie character, while scenes in "real life" are filmed with a hard-edged grittiness. (this construct is the reason given by director marshall why "class," performed by velma and mama, was cut from the film.) the musical itself was based on a 1926 broadway play by maurine watkins about two real-life jazz-era murderers beulah annan (roxie hart) and belva gaertner (velma kelly). the george abbott-directed production, starring francine larrimore and juliette crosby, ran for 172 performances at the music box theatre, and within a year was adapted to a film in which gaertner herself had a cameo. chicago was produced by american companies miramax films and the producers circle in association with the german company kallis productions. jennifer aniston, christina applegate,patricia arquette,drew barrymore,juilette binoche,cate blanchett, sandra bullock,toni collette,jamie lee curtis, ellen degeneres,cameron diaz,claire forlani,jodie foster, heather graham, rachel griffiths,angie harmon,anne heche,katie holmes,helen hunt, mila jovovich, ashley judd, pasty kensit,nicole kidman, lucy lawless,jennifer jason leigh, ta leoni, bette midler ( who was also offered the roles of velma and mama morton but turned them all down). rhona mitra,gwenyth paltrow, michelle pfeiffer, monica potter,vinessa shaw,alicia silverstone, mira sorvino,hilary swank, charzile theron, marisa tomei, debra winger, kate winslet and catherine zeta jones ( who instead was cast as velma) were all considered to play roxie hart. while madonna, neve campbell,winona ryder,julia roberts and angelina jolie were considered to play velma. additionally for the roles of mama morton, mary sunshine, billy flynn, amos hart and kitty baxter kathy bates, cher,whoopi goldberg,angelica houston,beyonce knowles were considered. for mary sunshine kim basinger and kristen chenoweth were considered. for billy john cusack,rupert everett,hugh jackman, kevin kline,sean penn,kevin spacy and john travolta were considered. for john.c.riellys role of amos hart keanu reeves and charlie sheen were considered and for kitty baxter mandy moore and britney spears were considered.

=== critical response ===
on review aggregation website rotten tomatoes, the film holds an 86% approval rating, based on 257 reviews, with an average rating of 8.02/10. the site's critics consensus states: "a rousing and energetic adaptation of the broadway musical, chicago succeeds on the level of pure spectacle, but provides a surprising level of depth and humor as well." on metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "universal acclaim". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "a" on an a+ to f scale.

the cast received widespread acclaim for their performances. tim robey, writer for the daily telegraph in the united kingdom, labeled chicago as "the best screen musical for 30 years." he also stated that it has taken a "three-step tango for us to welcome back the movie musical as a form." robey said "this particular chicago makes the most prolific use it possibly can out of one specific advantage the cinema has over the stage when it comes to song and dance: it's a sustained celebration of parallel montage." roger ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it "big, brassy fun". however, other reviews claimed that there were issues with the film being too streamlined, and minor complaints were made toward marshall's directing influences.

chicago, along with the 2001 musical moulin rouge! and the hip hop centered film 8 mile in 2002, is widely considered to be responsible for ushering a re-emergence of the musical film genre in the 21st century. following the success of chicago, many musical films have been released in cinemas, with several adapted from stage productions for broadway and london's west end, including phantom of the opera, the producers, rent, dreamgirls, hairspray, sweeney todd: the demon barber of fleet street, mamma mia!, nine, les misrables, rock of ages, the last five years, into the woods, cats, in the heights, dear evan hansen, and west side story. the 2013 scottish film sunshine on leith was also adapted from a stage production, originating with scotland's dundee repertory theatre.
japanese rock band buck-tick named their 2010 album razzle dazzle after the film's song of the same name.the revived interest in musical films has also brought remakes or sequels to earlier films, including beauty and the beast in 2017 (a live-action adaptation of disney's 1991 animated feature, itself adapted for broadway in 1994), the 2018 films: mamma mia: here we go again! (a sequel to 2008's mamma mia!), a star is born (a fourth version of the film following earlier productions in 1937, 1954, and 1976) and mary poppins returns (a sequel to 1964's mary poppins), and 2019 films: aladdin (a live-action adaptation of disney's 1992 animated feature, itself adapted for broadway in 2011) and the lion king (a photorealistic live-action adaptation of disney's 1994 animated feature, itself adapted for broadway in 1997). notable original and biographical musical films have also been released to critical and commercial success since chicago's cinematic run, including walk the line in 2005, once in 2006, enchanted in 2007, la la land in 2016, and rocketman in 2019. other original and biographical musical films that were released to commercial success with mixed critical reception, includes across the universe in 2007, the greatest showman in 2017, bohemian rhapsody in 2018, and yesterday in 2019.
