== critical reception ==
halliwell's film guide called the film "a slightly vulgar and talkative farce which restricts the star". a radio times reviewer commented, "although he was still britain's biggest box office attraction, george formby was already showing signs of the novelty fatigue that would result in the collapse of his screen career four years later...the cheeky wit that informed so many of formby's songs is to the fore in this contrived comedy, but the storyline about the handyman with aspirations to become an artist simply isn't strong enough to sustain so much smutty innuendo".
