== plot ==
fred sits in a dark room, detailing his most recent bank robbery. he talks about how he teamed up with hardened criminal johnny cabot to execute his plan.
cabot is about to take the wife of the bank's vice president hostage. he holds her until he receives a call from fred, informing him that they have the ransom money. cabot watches the wilson house as the husband leaves for work, and their son heads off to school. posing as a door-to-door guitar instructor, cabot talks his way into the house, and takes nancy wilson hostage.
at the bank, fred enters vice president ken wilson's office, and hands him a check for $70,000, informing wilson that he will withdraw the funds to cover the ransom or his wife will die. he tells wilson to call home for proof that nancy is being held hostage, then informs him that if he does not call cabot back in five minutes, mrs. wilson will die.
wilson surprisingly responds that he has been planning to leave his wife anyway, and runs off to las vegas with his mistress, ellen. he tells fred that he will be doing him a favor by killing his wife. fred does not believe that wilson will let his wife die. he is proven correct, as time ticks by, when wilson finally cracks and agrees to pay the ransom.
fred calls cabot, and starts the clock over again. after the five minutes have passed, fred works on wilson to hurry. meanwhile, at the wilson house, cabot is enjoying terrorizing his hostage. he begins forcing her to listen to his songs about her impending demise, shooting at her and making sexual advances toward her. back at the bank, fred has been taken down by the police, who arrived after someone tripped the silent alarm. as a result, cabot starts to become nervous, having not received his expected call from fred. suddenly, little bobby comes in, home for lunch.
the police arrive outside the house. in a panic, cabot grabs bobby and runs for it, running right into police gunfire. bobby pretends as though he has been shot in order to encourage cabot to put him down. after apparently being very upset by the accidental shooting of the young boy, cabot fires back, and is killed by police. nancy runs outside to find her son, still alive and well. the film ends with fred finishing his story to the police, then mr. wilson driving to las vegas, but with his wife, not his mistress.
