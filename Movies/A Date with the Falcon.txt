in his review of a date with the falcon, bosley crowther wrote, in the new york times, that,  a pattern existed in the falcon series "...  the pattern. mr. sanders, an idle man of the world, is just about to be marriedthis time to wendy barriewhen a mystifying crisis arisesthis time the disappearance of a scientist. obviously mr. sanders doesn't care to enter the case; he never doesor never did, perhaps we should say. but duty and the lure of adventure inevitably drag him in. and so, for fifty or sixty minutes, he is off on a serio-comic chase, sleuthing a gang of murderous smugglers, while his girl and the police act bored and dense."
