== production notes ==
it was the final film for seaton, who three years earlier had directed martin and an all-star cast in the blockbuster hit airport.  it was also dean martin's last western.
in a november 1972 episode of the tv series mcmillan & wife called cop of the year, mcmillan (played by hudson) visits the set of a western film titled "showdown" that is in production  (directed by seaton, who plays himself) to ask the special-effects supervisor about how to make a gunshot wound appear on the chest of a gunmanwho, in the shot being filmed, is the victim in a showdown.


== reception ==
quentin tarantino later wrote that "the slightness of the whole project is surprising. but along with the pairing of hudson & martin, who share the screen for the first time, its the films low-key modesty that ends up being one of its most charming features."
