rotten tomatoes, a review aggregator website, reports that 67% of nine surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.96/10. rick groen of the globe and mail rated it 2/4 stars and called it "a cinematic essay that occasionally seems smart and sometimes just smart-alecky." peter howell of the toronto star rated it 1.5/4 stars and wrote that harkema's comparison of the manson murders to the vietnam war "a dubious, illogical and frankly offensive connection to make". todd brown of twitch film wrote that "despite some very promising elements, harkema is just not quite up to the task."
