== books ==
saradindu bandopadhyay penned 32 byomkesh stories from 1932 to 1970 prior to his death. in his early stories, ajit kumar banerjee is described as his companion, and chronicler of his stories. but in some cases ajit also investigates in absence of byomkesh (examples, makorshar rosh, shoilo rahasya). the stories are all written in traditional formal bengali language. however, later the stories shift to more colloquial language. the later stories (room nombor dui, chhlonar chhondo, shajarur kanta, benisonghaar and lohar biskut) are not penned by ajit, who was engaged in his publication business.
the stories are not very complicated but very engaging, with a long series of surprising events. the stories present a range of crimes from the first story, satyanweshi, where byomkesh destroys an international drug racket, to household mysteries and crimes like arthamanartham and makorshar rosh.
sharadindu did not want to continue the byomkesh stories, due to which he stopped writing from 1938 to 1951. during that time he busied himself writing scripts for films in bombay. after his return to west bengal, byomkesh stories were still in demand so he wrote chitrachor (picture imperfect) in 1951 and other stories gradually on to 1970, when his last story "bishupal badh" (killing of bishupal) was left incomplete owing to his untimely death.
