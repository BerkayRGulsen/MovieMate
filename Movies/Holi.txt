the hostel superintendent professor singh (naseeruddin shah), the only lecturer with some links with the students, watches with apprehension their growing restlessness. a notice announcing a further postponement of examinations adds to the bitterness. a fight erupts out of nowhere between principal phande's (om puri) nephew and another student; the principal's nephew is hurt and the other boy is promptly rusticated. this is seen as a drastic punishment, and the news spreads like wildfire to all the students of the college. resistance is organized in the library, in the laboratory, in the classrooms and the college grounds as the students rebel against the principal. principal calls professor singh to give the name of the troublemakers but he refuses, the names are later given by one of the classmate and soon the boys are sent a suspension notice.
