== production ==
lohan's scenes were shot in 2010 for underground comedy 2010, a production that would have mixed newly filmed sketches with sketches from the original 1997 production of the underground comedy movie. the alcohol-detecting ankle monitor she was ordered to wear after she failed to show up for a court hearing is clearly visible as she stands on the street grate.
a trailer for underground comedy 2010 was released in august of that year. the project was eventually expanded to a fully new feature film with the production of additional new sketches. ari shaffir's segment mixed footage with unknowing collaborators and staged action, mostly using the same people brought back "to do a little extra so we can build a story or get me some comeuppance".the film is directed by vince offer, who also directed the underground comedy movie and, between the two films, became better known for his infomercial sales pitches (his best known product being the shamwow absorbent towel).
