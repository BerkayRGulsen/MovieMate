the soundtrack was composed by a. r. rahman with lyrics by vairamuthu. rahman reused the songs in may maadham's unreleased hindi remake love you hamesha, and the telugu dub hrudayaanjali. the song "margazhi poove" is set in hindolam raaga, while "enmel vizhundha mazhaithuli" is set in kapi. "margazhi poove" was inspired from suprabhatam rendered by carnatic vocalist m. s. subbulakshmi. about "margazhi poove", vairamuthu recalled, "id written the song margazhi poove [...] suddenly, [rahman] came out of the recording room and asked for some lyrics for a short tune that plays between the bgm. he gave me the tune and i told him one cannot fit words into such a tune. but he persisted, saying, i can if i wanted to. of course, i was a bit irritated, but the challenge that he threw forced me to make an attempt. and i succeeded: venba... paadivarum vandukku/ senthaen... thandhuvidum sempookkal/ konjam... paadavarum pennukku/ sandham... thandhuvidum mynahkkal."

== release and reception ==
may maadham was released on 9 september 1994. malini mannath of the indian express wrote on the same day, "despite its flaws, may maadham is an engaging little film that is worth viewing". indolink wrote "its a.r.rehmaan who again comes to the rescue in this love story that loses direction to say the least. a simple story of love that doesnt have any unnecessary opposition (thank heavens) should have been more efficiently handled as there isnt much scope for melodrama here. so the director decided to adopt a tongue-in-cheek attitude, with crazy mohan's script coming in handy, but after the half way stage, it fails to grip you and you just wait there for it to end".
