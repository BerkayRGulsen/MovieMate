== plot ==
top defense contractor globotech industries acquires the heartland toy company and as part of the move, globotech ceo gil mars commissions heartland toy designers larry benson and irwin wayfair to develop actual live action toys capable of "playing back". mars selects larry's commando elite for the project and irwin's gorgonites for their enemies. faced with a tight three-month deadline for the toys' release, larry forgoes safety testing, then uses irwin's password and chooses globotech's x1000 microprocessor to activate the toys.
alan abernathy signs off for a shipment of the toys at his family's toy store without his father's consent. he and delivery driver joe activate archer and chip hazard. alan's neighbor and love interest, christy fimple, buys chip hazard as a birthday present for her brother, timmy. alan returns home to discover archer in his backpack. in the meantime, the commando elite apparently attack the gorgonites in the toy store. alan calls the company and files a complaint. later, when larry and irwin listen to alan's voice mail, irwin is terrified to discover the x1000 was designed for smart munitions guidance; a globotech engineer reveals the artificial intelligence circuit is designed to learn over time, but mass production was scrapped due to issues with electromagnetic pulse shielding.
the commando elite pursue alan to his home and attempt to interrogate and kill archer in the kitchen. alan intervenes and is wounded by nick nitro, whom he partially destroys by shoving in the garbage disposal. his parents, stuart and irene, arrive in the kitchen, having been alerted by the sounds of the scuffle there. alan attempts to explain what is going on, but with archer not supporting his explanation, neither of his parents believe him. the next day, alan and archer find the gorgonites in a dumpster at the store. at home, alan learns the goal of the gorgonites is to seek their home gorgon, which they mistakenly believe to be in yosemite national park. through tapping the abernathys' phone line, the commando elite learn of alan's interest in christy, tie up and gag her brother,  sedate and subdue the fimples and use the destroyed nick nitros ai chip to engineer an army of gwendy fashion dolls as reinforcements. the commando elite then take christy hostage to force alan into surrendering the gorgonites.
alan and archer sneak into the fimples' house to save christy, but the gwendy dolls subdue alan. archer cuts christy loose from her bonds, and together they save alan and destroy the gwendys before escaping. the commando elite pursue them in improvised vehicles, but all except chip hazard are destroyed in a crash. alan, christy and archer return to alan's house, only to find both their families waiting for them, believing that alan kidnapped christy and immobilized the fimples. this time, stuart and irene believe alan and christy's account of the gorgonites and the commando elite, but phil and marion, christy's parents, remain skeptical. irwin and larry arrive and talk to alan about his voicemail. at that moment, chip hazard attacks the house with a new force of commando elite from a hijacked recall shipment by joe and with more improvised vehicles and weapons. the commando elite attack the gorgonites and the humans, resulting in the house's electricity supply being cut off.
inspired by irwin's advice to create an emp blast, alan heads out to force an overload of the power lines. christy, irwin, and larry head to the fimples' house to turn on all electronic items inside and wedge the circuit breakers open for a larger surge. the gorgonites emerge and fight back against the commando elite. chip hazard flies to the top of the power line pole to stop alan, where he battles and defeats archer, but is thrust by alan into the power transformers, triggering the emp blast, which destroys chip hazard along with the remaining commando elite.
mars arrives in his helicopter during the police and fire department cleanup the next day. he pays joe, the fimples, and the abernathys for damages, as well as buying their silence from the media, and orders larry and irwin to repurpose the commando elite for a military use. among the craziness of the aftermath, alan and christy part on highly amicable terms, having agreed to start a relationship with each other. alan later discovers the gorgonites have screened themselves from the emp blast by hiding underneath the fimples' large satellite dish. the abernathys bring the gorgonites to yosemite national park, where alan sends them out in a large toy boat from his father's store to find their home of gorgon.

== production ==
on making the film, director joe dante recalled, "originally i was told to make an edgy picture for teenagers, but when the sponsor tie-ins came in the new mandate was to soften it up as a kiddie movie. too late, as it turned out, and there are elements of both approaches in there. just before release it was purged of a lot of action and explosions." on the film's special effects, dante stated, "we were planning to use a lot of stan winston's puppetshe had made some very elaborate puppets that could do a lot of things. but in practice, we found it was much simpler and cheaper to let the cgi people do the work after we'd shot the scenes. so, i would say, it's one-third puppetry and the rest cgi in small soldiers, even though the original idea was to do mostly puppetry."
