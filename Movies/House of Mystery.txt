== critical reception ==
the radio times gave the film three out of five stars, saying, "this is a neat little spine-tingler from writer/director vernon sewell, who was something of a dab hand at summoning up demons from beyond, whether benign as in the ghosts of berkeley square or downright menacing as in the blood beast terror. some aficionados would insist that if it ain't hammer it ain't horror, but there are plenty of uneasy moments in this haunting story, in which a couple of newlyweds learn the grim secret of their dream house." 
the bloody pit of horror wrote, "though modest, ultimately predictable and nothing spectacular, it's well-acted and at least manages to maintain interest." 
britmovie called the film an "effectively macabre little b-movie narrated in several multi-layered flashbacks."
