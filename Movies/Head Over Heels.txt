annoyed by the police's lack of effort, amanda and her new friends investigate jim on their own. when amanda confronts him, he turns out to be an undercover fbi agent, bob smoot, who was trying to gain a suspect's trust by staging his partner megan's death. amanda learns that jim is investigating a russian named strukov (jay brazeau), who, under the alias of halloran, has been smuggling money. he is also the client for whom amanda has been privately restoring a painting.
