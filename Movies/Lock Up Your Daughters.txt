== reception ==
in his review in the new york times, roger greenspun wrote: "...a three-strand plot that has been so smothered in atmosphere, activity and authenticity that even the great traditions of theatrical untruth cannot breathe life into it. the production values of "lock up your daughters!" are ambitious enough to fill three movies, but they are not sufficient to substitute for one."
