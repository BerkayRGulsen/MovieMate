== reception ==
on its initial 1931 release, the new york times commented that the film "takes no exception from the tradition of viennese legends of battle" with characters, setting, music, and plot all typical of films set in wartime vienna, and that the audience responded to it like "an old friend".  critic paul mavis later wrote that the film had "a good performance by twelvetrees doing what people wanted a female spy to do in 1931." the film was overshadowed by another, similarly themed 1931 release, director josef von sternberg's dishonored starring marlene dietrich.
