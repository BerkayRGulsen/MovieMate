they stop in coolidge, kansas to visit ellen's cousin catherine and her husband eddie, who foist cranky aunt edna and her mean dog dinky on the griswolds, asking them to drop her off at her son norman's home in phoenix.
after stopping at a decrepit and dirty campground in south fork, colorado for the night, clark forgets to untie dinky's leash from the bumper before driving off the next morning, killing the dog. a motorcycle cop pulls the griswolds over and angrily lectures clark over animal cruelty, but accepts clark's apology. edna learns of her dog's death and becomes more irate with clark. exiting colorado, ellen loses her bag which had her credit cards, forcing clark to cash a check for future spending.
while ellen and clark argue during a drive between utah and arizona, they crash and become stranded in the desert near monument valley. clark and rusty have a bonding experience explaining why clark wants to take this vacation. after setting off alone in the desert to look for help, clark eventually reunites with his family, who have been rescued and taken to a local mechanic. the mechanic extorts clark's remaining cash only to render the car barely operational. frustrated, they stop at the grand canyon. when clark is unable to convince a hotel clerk to cash a personal check because his credit card was reported stolen, he raids the cash register behind the clerk's back and leaves the check.
leaving, they find that aunt edna has died in her sleep. they tie her corpse to the roof of the car, wrapped in a tarpaulin. when they reach norman's home, they discover he is out of town so they leave edna's body by the back door with a note. the family has a small memorial for her. overwhelmed by the mishaps they have encountered during the road trip, ellen and the children want to go back home, but clark has become obsessed with reaching walley world and they continue on. after an argument with ellen, clark eventually meets the ferrari-driving blonde beauty at a hotel and goes skinny-dipping with her in its pool, but they are discovered by the family before anything intimate happens. ellen forgives clark and the couple goes skinny-dipping themselves.
despite the family's misfortunes, they finally arrive at walley world the next day only to discover the park closed for the next two weeks for repairs. finally slipping into madness and realizing that all his efforts have been for nothing, clark buys a realistic-looking bb gun and demands that park security guard russ lasky take them through walley world. ellen and the kids follow, attempting to placate clark. eventually, an lapd swat team arrives, along with park owner roy walley. roy understands clark's impassioned longing to achieve the perfect vacation, bringing back memories of his own family vacation headaches. he decides not to file criminal charges against the griswolds and lets the family  along with the swat team  enjoy the park as his guests. the final shot shows that the family flew back to chicago with souvenir hats.

== production ==
during the chicago blizzard of 1979, writer john hughes began developing a short story entitled "vacation '58" for an issue of the national lampoon. while the story ended up being bumped from the initial vacation-themed issue, it was eventually published in september 1979 and subsequently optioned by warner bros. "when i brought it to hollywood, the first guy i brought it to was jeff katzenberg who was at paramount," recalled producer matty simmons, who worked as a publisher at the national lampoon. "he said it would never make a movie, it was too episodic, too consequential. i said, 'yeah, it's a road trip. it's supposed to be episodic. you go from town to town, place to place.' but he didnt like it, so then my agent brought it to warner brothers, and i met with them. most of them said the same thing, but there was one executive over therea guy named mark cantonwho really pulled for it and it got made." upon simmons' agreement with warner bros., hughes was assigned the task of adapting his original story into a screenplay.


=== filming ===
filming began in july 1982 and lasted 55 days. parts of the film were shot in monument valley, utah; flagstaff, sedona, and the grand canyon in arizona; santa anita racetrack in arcadia and magic mountain in california; southern colorado, and st. louis, missouri.


=== walley world ===
in hughes' original short story, the theme park was disneyland. to avoid legal troubles, all of the names associated with disneyland were altered to sound-alikes. for instance, the park became walley world, itself a good-natured parody of the anaheim location, and the mascot, marty moose, is reminiscent of walt disney's own mickey mouse.  similarly, roy walley's appearance bears similarities to that of disney and his name is similar to that of his brother roy disney.in the film, the walley world theme park is represented by santa anita park in arcadia, california and six flags magic mountain in valencia, california. santa anita park's large parking lot and blue-tinged fascia served as the exterior of walley world, while all park interior scenes were shot at magic mountain. the two roller coasters seen in the film are la revolucin, which can be recognized by the vertical loop, and colossus (currently twisted colossus), the double-track wooden roller coaster.
the movie's popularity gave rise to an ongoing cultural running gag of using the name "wally world" (spelled as "wally" without an "e") as a nickname for real-life retailer walmart.


=== wagon queen family truckster ===

the wagon queen family truckster station wagon was created specifically for the film. it is based on a 1979 ford ltd country squire station wagon. the car was designed by george barris, and it lampooned american cars of the late 1970s. the truckster features a pale avocado metallic green paint scheme, extensive imitation wood-paneling decals, eight headlights (the second pair was taken from another crown victoria/country squire and mounted upside-down above the stock pair), a grille area largely covered by bodywork with only two small openings close to the bumper, an oddly-placed fuel filler door and an airbag made from a trashcan liner.


== music ==
the musical score for national lampoon's vacation was composed by ralph burns, featuring original songs by lindsey buckingham. a soundtrack album was released in 1983 by warner bros. records. while the album did not chart, buckingham's single "holiday road" reached number 82 on the billboard hot 100.
