alexandre goyette wrote the film, based on his play. director daniel grou, under his professional pseudonym "podz", filmed king dave in five unbroken shots, in five nights. however, all of the footage seen in the released film was taken in the fifth night of shots. podz said that unlike other "one-shot films" such as alfred hitchcock's rope, this method was not to portray action in real time, but to portray the character narrating in real time. despite the challenges in the proposed project, producer nicole robert was eager to make it and raised a budget of $4.7 million. art director andr guimond then went location scouting, choosing an area of montreal for shooting.rehearsals took place for weeks before filming commenced. difficulties on the fourth day caused all of the footage to be unused. twenty locations were used.
