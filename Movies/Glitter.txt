glitter is a 2001 american romantic musical drama film starring mariah carey and rapper da brat, written by kate lanier, and directed by vondie curtis hall. it is set in 1983. carey plays billie frank, an aspiring singer who, along with her friends louise (da brat) and roxanne (tia texada), is a club dancer. timothy walker (terrence howard) offers them a contract as backup singers/dancers to another singer. at the premiere of the song they record, billie meets julian "dice" black (max beesley), a nightclub dj, who helps her in her solo career. in the process, billie and dice fall in love.
carey began working on a film and soundtrack project titled all that glitters in 1997. however, during that period, her label columbia records pressured her to release a compilation album in time for the holiday season in november 1998. consequently, carey put all that glitters on hold. following this, she aimed to complete the film and album project for the summer of 2001. shooting began in toronto and new york at the end of september 2000. carey used the time to work on the soundtrack of the film, along with eric bent and da brat, who also appeared on the film.
the film was released on september 21, 2001, ten days after the release of the accompanying soundtrack on september 11, 2001. before its release, carey was suddenly hospitalized, citing "extreme exhaustion" and a "physical and emotional breakdown". due to this, the film and soundtrack release was postponed for three weeks. glitter was heavily panned by critics and was a box office failure. reviewers were highly disappointed with the film, and carey's performance as an actress was considered by many to be amateur. this also caused the film to receive negative commentary on social media sites, with carey herself later admitting that she regretted being part of the film. some went on to call it one of the worst films ever made. glitter opened in 1,996 american theatres, and grossed $2.5 million in its first week, with a worldwide total of $5.3 million. the soundtrack of the film had some commercial success and went on to sell three million copies worldwide, considerably less than carey's previous releases.

== production ==

in 1997, american singer mariah carey began working on a film and soundtrack project titled all that glitters. however, during that period, her record company columbia records pressured carey to release a compilation album, in time for the favorable holiday season in november. consequently, carey put all that glitters on hold, and released the compilation in november 1998. following an additional studio album in 1999, titled rainbow, the project was delayed. she published some of the material on rainbow, in which she fully exerted creative control over the album and its sound, and then, carey completed her contract with columbia records. later, she signed a us$100 million record deal with virgin records (emi records). carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project. she opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres, in order to go hand-in-hand with the film's setting. as the release date grew nearer, the movie and album title were changed from all that glitters to glitter. carey developed the film's concept, which was later expanded by kate lanier. she said they rewrote a lot of the screenplay on the set and it came from improvisation. filming sessions were held in new york city and toronto in late september 2000.


== release and promotion ==

following commencement for glitter and the release of the soundtrack's lead single "loverboy", carey embarked on a short promotional campaign for the song and its parent album. however, during the campaign, carey exhibited what was reported as "erratic behavior." on july 17, 2001, carey was interviewed on the program 106 & park on the bet network. during the interview, carey hid her thighs behind large pillows and ranted that her life was "one day that was continuous". two days later, on july 19, carey made a surprise appearance on the mtv program trl. she came out onto the filming stage, pushing an ice cream cart while wearing an oversized shirt. seemingly anxious and exhilarated, carey began giving out individual bars of ice cream to fans and guests on the program, while waving to the crowd down below on times square, while diverging into a rambling monologue regarding therapy. carey then walked to daly's platform and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble, leading him to exclaim "mariah carey has lost her mind!"

the next day, on july 20, carey held a record signing for the soundtrack's lead single "loverboy" at roosevelt field shopping mall in long island before fans and the media. as a camera crew covered the event, she began rambling on several subjects before finally discussing radio-host howard stern, and how his form of humor on his program bothered her greatly. at that point, carey's publicist cindi berger grabbed the microphone from her hand, and asked the news crew to stop filming. within a few days, carey posted erratic voice messages on her website which were soon taken down. on july 26, she was hospitalized, citing "extreme exhaustion" and a "physical and emotional breakdown". following her induction at an un-disclosed hospital in connecticut, carey remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public.following carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, virgin records and 20th century fox delayed the release of both glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name. the announcement was made on august 9, 2001, that both the soundtrack and the film would be postponed three weeks, respectively from august 21 to september 11, and from august 31 to september 21. when asked regarding the motives behind the delay, nancy berry, vice chairman of virgin music group worldwide, addressed carey's personal and physical condition:

mariah is looking forward to being able to participate in both her album and movie projects and we are hopeful that this new soundtrack release date will allow her to do so. she has been making great recovery progress, and continues to grow stronger every day. virgin music worldwide continues to give its absolute commitment and support to mariah on every level.
carey's first promotional appearance to promote the film itself was on its opening day on fox theater, westwood village in jeans and a black tank top adorned with an american flag, paying homage to victims of the september 11 attacks. after giving interviews and signing autographs, carey sat in the center section of the theatre flanked by security guards and handlers, along with audience members who had won tickets through los angeles radio station power 106. during her appearance, carey said she hoped that glitter would provide movie-goers an emotional escape during the attacks' aftermath in the country. "but obviously nothing can overshadow the events that have gone on, and i need to stay focused on that," she completed.fashions in the film were highlighted by costume designer joseph g. aulisi. showcased were clothing by soo luen tom, luis sequeira, richard saenz, renee fontana, and michael warbrock.

== reception ==


=== box office ===

glitter was released in the united states on september 21, 2001. on its opening day, the film grossed an estimated $786,436 in 1,202 theaters. on the first weekend of its release, glitter was the eleventh highest-grossing film, grossing an estimate of $2,414,596. by the second week, the film dropped 61.1% on tickets sales, ranking at number 15 on the box office. it was originally scheduled to open over labor day weekend, but the film was pushed back three weeks when carey was admitted to a hospital for what she stated was extreme exhaustion. glitter was a commercial failure, grossing a total $4,274,407 in the united states. worldwide, the film grossed a total of $5,271,666 until its close day, on october 18, 2001.in an interview in 2010, carey stated that she believed that the film's failure at the box office was largely due to the soundtrack's release date being september 11, 2001, the same day as the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon. she said, "here's the thing that a lot of people don't know, that movie was released on september 11, 2001  could there be a worse day for that movie to come out? ... i don't even know that many people even saw the movie."


=== critical response ===
glitter has a rating of 6% on rotten tomatoes based on 86 reviews with an average score of 2.8/10. the consensus states "glitter is a hodgepodge of movie cliches and bad acting that's sure to generate unintentional laughs. unfortunately, the movie is not bad enough to be good." on metacritic the film has a score of 14 out of 100 based on 23 reviews indicating "overwhelming dislike". criticism focused on carey's acting, melodramatic plot, and various anachronisms.
the village voice proclaimed, "for her part, carey seems most concerned about keeping her lips tightly sealed like a kid with braces, and when she tries for an emotionany emotionshe looks as if she's lost her car keys." roger ebert spoke relatively well of carey's individual performance saying, "her acting ranges from dutiful flirtatiousness to intense sincerity ..." however, he ended with, "and above all, the film is lacking in joy. it never seems like it's fun to be billie frank."
intended as a vehicle to break mariah carey as a movie star, it instead became a year-long punch line. carey might have a five-octave voice, but her performance as a burgeoning singer was strictly one-note and garnered her a razzie for worst actress. trotting out every hoary clich about the music business imaginable, glitter isn't just one of the worst music-themed films ever made  it's one of the worst films ever made, period. 
lawrence van gelder of the new york times said, "glitter is mostly dross, an unintentionally hilarious compendium of time-tested cinematic clichs that illustrate the chasm between hopeful imitation and successful duplication." total film magazine reviewed the film extremely negatively, awarding it just one star and stating, "it can't even scale heights of campy awfulness. this isn't so bad it's good, it's so bad it's actionable ... an inept star vehicle that starts out desperately tedious and gets less interesting. leaves you wishing the lumire brothers had said bollocks to cinema and gone down the pub." the film is listed in golden raspberry award founder john wilson's book the official razzie movie guide as one of the 100 most enjoyably bad movies ever made.


=== actors response ===
carey herself has also openly dismissed and distanced herself from the film; she stated in 2002 that "[the film] started out as a concept with substance, but it ended up being geared to 10-year-olds. it lost a lot of grit. it was gritless, in fact. i kind of got in over my head." in december 2013, during a visit to the bravo nightly series watch what happens: live, carey revealed to host andy cohen that she considered glitter the biggest regret of her career, calling it a "kitsch moment in history ... in the history of my life". she told cohen that the film wreaked havoc on her career; "it was a horrible couple of years (after the film's release) and then i had to get my momentum back for people to let it go"; she also added that she wouldn't let anyone around her mention the film in conversation and that it was known as "the g word". for two decades, carey refused to sing any song from the film's soundtrack in her concerts. in 2020, carey released her memoir, the meaning of mariah carey, which highlighted her experiences throughout the release of the film. she called it "a collision of bad luck, bad timing, and sabotage".da brat also claimed the film was a "major commercial failure and critical flop". in 2019, brat filed for bankruptcy after having to owe a rapper, shayla stevens, $8 million dollars. after "been subjected to physical threats, stalking and harassment", brat denied earning any money from her social media and from her acting role in glitter. she stated that "the last song she was credited for working on with mariah was in 2001 and they have not released music since she got out of prison" and that she was "paid the sag-aftra 'scale' rate which is the basic minimum daily rate for a day's work for each day in the medium". in 2015, brat stated in a billboard interview, that she was proud of how her and carey "made history on some of those songs. shes sold millions of records, and i was very happy to be a part of [it]".max beesley also commented on the film's reception stating that it "was a disaster". he went on to say in an interview with the guardian, that in the film, there was originally "some heavy-duty drama [...] and mariah really showed her acting boots" but "they just cut all that out and [he] nearly cried when [he] saw it". he went on to defend the film by saying, "it was released on september 12, the day after the atrocities, so it was dead". tia texada, who played roxanne, also spoke on the film with chaunce hayden of steppin out in 2003, stating that the film "was a disaster from the time [she] got there". she went on to speak ill of carey saying that "working with [her] was really hard". conversely, terrence howards praised carey and beesley's performances, noting his "emotional experiences" with beesley, calling him angelic and talented. he also added that the "experience and getting to know mariah" was better than "the product".


=== accolades ===
at the 22nd golden raspberry awards, the film was 3rd place with six nominations including worst picture and worst screen couple and one win, for carey who received the razzie award for worst actress.


== soundtrack ==

the accompanying soundtrack, glitter, became carey's lowest showing on the charts. the first single, "loverboy", peaked at number two on the us billboard hot 100 chart, but that was only after virgin records spurred sales of the single by dropping the price down to 99 cents. "never too far", the album's second release, was released on october 23, 2001. it failed to impact the main billboard chart, and achieved weak international charting. carey was unable to film a music video for the single, as she was still recovering from her breakdown. instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where billie frank (played by carey) sings the song at madison square garden during her first sold-out concert. frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.the album's third single, "don't stop (funkin' 4 jamaica)", released on december 10, 2001, mirrored the same weak charting as "never too far", although receiving more rotation on mtv due to its video. directed by sanaa hamri, it features the theme of southern bayous and lifestyles, and presents carey and mystikal in "southern style" clothing and hairstyles. some shots feature three versions of carey singing into a microphone on the screen at one time. the final single released from glitter was "reflections (care enough)", which received a limited release in japan on december 15, 2001. following its limited promotional push from virgin, and the absence of a music video, the song failed to make much of an impact. the album itself struggled to reach gold certification, but since its 2001 release has been certified platinum. virgin records dropped carey from the label due to the poor sales of the album and canceled their $100 million contract with her.


=== #justiceforglitter ===
in november 2018, the soundtrack became the subject of a campaign by carey fans as part of the build-up to her fifteenth studio album, caution. promoted on social media with the hashtag #justiceforglitter, the campaign resulted in the album reaching number one on the itunes albums charts in several countries including the united states, and top 10 in several countries worldwide. carey herself acknowledged and praised the campaign through social media and interviews. she eventually added a medley of songs from the album on her caution world tour, as a thank you to her fans.
