mike asks one of his informants and ex-girlfriend maxine "max" logan (karen alexander) to look for people who are newly rich and therefore suspects. she gets herself and her best friend julie mott (ta leoni) hired as escorts by eddie dominguez (emmanuel xuereb), a former crooked cop. the party is soon interrupted by dominguez's french drug kingpin boss fouchet (tchky karyo) and his henchmen casper, ferguson and noah. dominguez and max are killed, while julie manages to escape. the madam who hired julie and max is disposed of by one of fouchet's men. 
frantically calling the police station, julie insists on talking only to mike, who is away. knowing she never met mike, captain conrad howard (joe pantoliano) forces marcus to impersonate mike to talk to her. at her apartment, marcus and julie are attacked by some of fouchet's henchmen, one of whom marcus kills. when they rendezvous with mike, marcus and mike have to impersonate each other, with mike living at the burnett residence while marcus resides with julie at mike's apartment. the two struggle to keep it up in julie's presence, and she quickly begins to suspect the truth.
looking through mugshots, julie identifies noah as one of the henchmen. the trio go to club hell, one of noah's known hangouts. after being spotted, marcus knocks casper unconscious during a bathroom fight. julie tries to kill fouchet but marcus stops her. in the ensuing car chase, mike kills noah. the three manage to get away, but are caught on camera by a news helicopter and the report is later seen by marcus's family, who were told that marcus was temporarily reassigned to cleveland.
mike and marcus meet their old informant jojo (michael imperioli) and learn about the location of the chemist who is cutting the stolen drugs. the three return to mike's apartment, where marcus's wife theresa confronts them and confirms julie's suspicion they have been impersonating each other. fouchet's gang shows up and kidnaps julie.
mike and marcus's department is shut down by internal affairs. despite being reassigned, howard delays the order, giving mike and marcus more time to solve the case. they access dominguez's private police database profile and learn that the police secretary francine is dominguez's former girlfriend, who is being blackmailed by fouchet after he obtained nude photos of her.
marcus, mike and two other detectives, sanchez, and ruiz (nestor serrano and julio oscar mechoso) head to the miami-opa locka executive airport. after a fierce shootout, they kill the remainder of fouchet's henchmen, including casper and ferguson, and rescue julie. they chase a fleeing fouchet and force his car into a concrete barrier. as fouchet tries to flee, mike shoots fouchet in the leg and arrests him at gunpoint. after a tense conversation with marcus, fouchet surreptitiously draws a gun but is shot to death by mike before he can kill marcus, avenging max's death. an exhausted marcus leaves julie with mike and heads home, eager to be reunited with his wife.

== production ==
principal photography began on june 27, 1994, at the dade tire company near downtown miami, the city chosen to replace the original new york locale. filming continued throughout the area, including south beach's tides hotel, the mediterranean biltmore hotel, the dade county courthouse and a multimillion-dollar estate on a private island. the second floor of downtown miami's alfred dupont building was converted into a police station; a freighter on the miami river into a drug lab. bad boys' climactic scenes were filmed at the opa-locka airport. production wrapped on august 31. in the film's early stages of development, simpson and bruckheimer initially envisioned dana carvey and jon lovitz in the roles.  when the film was written for carvey and lovitz, the original title for bad boys was bulletproof hearts. arsenio hall turned down the role of lowrey and cites that choice as the worst mistake he has ever made. the role eventually went to smith. both lawrence and smith were starring in their own hit tv shows, martin and the fresh prince of bel-air, when filming bad boys. the fresh prince of bel-air even references the film in an episode. in the season 6, episode 20, called "i stank horse", nicholas "nicky" banks tells will that his parents will not let him watch bad boys, to which will replies, "bad boys, huh? what'cha gonna do?"


=== improvisation ===
director bay did not like the script and often engaged smith and lawrence in discussions about how the dialogue and scenes could improve. he often allowed them to improvise while the cameras were rolling. he secretly told smith to call lawrence a bitch before the car scene. the whole "two bitches in the sea" was improvised, as was lawrence's comment when leoni called him gay. the scene in the convenience store, wherein the clerk puts a gun to burnett and lowrey's heads and yells, telling them to "freeze, mother bitches!", is also improvised. they came up with: "no, you freeze, bitch! now back up, put the gun down and get me a pack of tropical fruit bubbalicious". "and some skittles." according to bay in the dvd commentary, at the end of the film when mike and marcus are recuperating, mike says "i love you, man." bay claims that smith refused to say the line, causing the director and actor to argue back and forth over the line. bay wanted smith to say the line as he felt it summed up the friendship between the cops. after their argument had lasted for half of the day's shoot and much of the crew was ready to pack up, a fed up bay told smith to do whatever he wanted, after which smith changed his mind and agreed to say the line.
