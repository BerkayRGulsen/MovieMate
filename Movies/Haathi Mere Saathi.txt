== quotes on the film ==
in an interview, tanuja said, "i showed them the film when kajol was six and tanishaa around three years old, and for two weeks kajol did not speak to me!! "mummy, you killed the elephant! because of you, he had to die!" screamed kajol! "and tanishaa was annoyed too!" tanuja loved working with the elephants after some initial apprehensions. "they really began to like me, especially the she-elephant who played ramu. there is a sequence where he had to push me through a door and fight a snake that was about to bite the baby, but the elephant had got so fond of me that he refused to do so! finally, they had to shoot separate close-ups of the elephant and my back and of me falling down!"on its 40th anniversary on 5 may 2011, pyarelal recalled, "laxmi (laxmikant) and devar got along fabulously well! devar had an innate music sense and a feel for rhythm, and he loved our title-track. but the tussle came up over the sad song, "nafrat ki duniya", which was the only song sung by (mohammed) rafisaab in the film. i recall voicing my doubts. but laxmi, the director and rajesh khanna were staunchly in favour of keeping that song. and the audience cried with the song and anand bakshisaab's lyrics."
