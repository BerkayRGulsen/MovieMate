a series of seemingly unconnected murders takes place in london, with the murderer leaving a calling card signed "the marquess". aspiring novelist and amateur detective paul temple and his wife steve are called in to investigate. an ancient papyrus scroll recently excavated in egypt by the menacing archaeologist sir felix raybourne (played by christopher lee) appears to hold the key to the murders. it details an antidote for all narcotic drugs, which if put to use could put an end to lucrative criminal drug cartels in london. the screenplay was adapted from the radio serial paul temple intervenes, broadcast in november 1942.

== critical reception ==
tv guide called the film a "standard murder mystery," and britmovie agreed, adding, "b-movie director maclean rogers keeps the story moving at a brisk pace and makes good use of exterior locations." as with the previous films in this series, the location footage (this time london, particularly at night), is highly evocative of the period. renown pictures has issued all four on dvd.
