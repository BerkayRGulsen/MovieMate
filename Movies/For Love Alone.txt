the film was a pet project for margaret fink who took six years to raise finance. the bulk of the money came from a pre-sale to greater union and from ua. fink had been impressed by stir and asked stephen wallace to direct.fay weldon wrote some early drafts but neither fink or wallace were happy with them so wallace did the adaptation himself. wallace says it took him three and a half years to write the script.peter strauss was originally cast to play james quick but was replaced by sam neill. genevieve picot was tentatively cast in the lead role but it took two years to raise the money by which time it was felt she was too old so she was replaced by helen buday, who had only made one film previously.most of the movie was shot in sydney starting in march 1985 with a four-day shoot at oxford university.


== reception ==
the movie received poor reviews. stephen wallace says he was particularly shocked by the reviews from feminists and women's magazines. "they attacked it so viciously. so i guess it wasn't a totally competent film. i know it was a bit slow and clumsy and i have to accept that."for love alone grossed $193,000 at the box office in australia which was considered a disappointment. stephen wallace regrets his treatment of the subject matter was not bolder.
