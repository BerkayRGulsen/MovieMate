== reception ==
writing for the spectator in 1936, graham greene gave the film a poor review. greene criticized jerome kern's musical score as "pompous and middle-aged" in contrast to the times which were more in line with fresh musicians like cole porter, and he complained that grace moore's performance had seemed "ponderous". the only portion of the film that greene found to provide a light touch was that of the performing seal.the film recorded a loss of $350,000.
