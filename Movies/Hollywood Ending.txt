val waxman is a once-prestigious film director who now directs television commercials. when he is thrown off his latest effort (a deodorant commercial filmed in the frozen north of canada), he desperately seeks a real movie project.
out of the blue, val receives an offer to direct a big-budget blockbuster to be set in new york city. however, the offer comes from his former wife, ellie, and her boyfriend, hal, the studio head who stole her from val years ago.
pushed by his agent al hack, val reluctantly agrees to the project, but a psychosomatic ailment strikes him blind just before production is to begin. with al's encouragement and aid, val keeps his blindness a secret from the cast and crew (and hal). during filming, val rekindles his relationship with ellie and reconnects with his estranged son, tony, while his much younger girlfriend, lori, leaves him. when val regains what had been missing his life, he regains his sight as well, and realizes that the movie he directed while blind is a disaster.
sure enough, the movie flops - but is a hit in france, where he is invited to direct a film. after winning ellie back, he happily proclaims, "thank god the french exist."
