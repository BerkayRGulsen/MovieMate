frank miniver, aka fast-walking, is a corrupt but lovable oregon state prison guard. not the most obliging or honest of public servants, he smokes and peddles marijuana and complements his meager salary by running prostitutes for mexican laborers out of his cousin evie's convenience store.
at work, he is in close contact with his other cousin wasco, who is incarcerated. wasco is involved in vice operations within the prison and outside of it. he peddles women, narcotics, and is looking to get into fraudulent banking operations. he bullies a competitor called bullet into turning over his in-prison operations to wasco.
an accomplice to wasco on the outside is an attractive young woman called moke. she carries on his bidding, which means even seducing fast-walking with sex. a black political prisoner named galliot soon arrives at the prison and wasco plots to have him killed in the racially tense environment. fast-walking arranges to have galliot sprung from prison. galliot offers him $50,000 and a secret key hidden in his belt buckle that is to a safe-deposit box.
wasco eventually learns about fast-walking and moke having an intense sexual relationship and becomes jealous. so he launches a scheme to have moke kill galliot, which she does with a high-powered rifle as he nearly gets away dressed as a prison guard. but fast-walking soon teaches him that what goes around, comes around.
