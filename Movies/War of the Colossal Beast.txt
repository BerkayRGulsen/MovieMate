upon hearing of several recent robberies of food delivery trucks in mexico, joyce manning (sally fraser), army officer lt. colonel glenn manning's sister, becomes convinced that her brother (dean parkin) survived his fall from the boulder dam (as seen in the amazing colossal man). along with army officer major mark baird (roger pace) and scientist dr. carmichael (russ bender), joyce goes to mexico to look for glenn and finds that he has, in fact, survived, but was left disfigured and nearly mindless by the trauma of his fall. manning is eventually captured, drugged by the army, and transported back to the united states. he is able to escape again and goes on a rampage through los angeles and hollywood. he nearly kills a school bus full of children. joyce reasons with him, and he slowly is brought back to his senses. now realizing what he has become and what he has done, manning commits suicide by electrocuting himself on high-voltage power lines near the griffith observatory.

== production ==
war of the colossal beast was produced, directed, and written by bert i. gordon and co-produced with samuel z. arkoff. although most of it is shot in black-and-white, the ending was shot in color for the electrocution scene and doctored in black-and-white. the producers decided to use the very heavy make-up on dean parkin as a way to disguise the fact that a different actor was playing colonel manning, especially since a dream sequence flashing back to the original film featured glenn langan, the star of the earlier film.. dean parkin also played the lead monster role in another bert i. gordon film, the cyclops.


== reception ==
contemporary film fan-historians kim r. holston and tom winchester noted that the film was "... a low-budget ship with bert gordon at the helm, so the special effects are unsurprisingly average; one always knows the 'giant' was filmed separately and mixed in with other shots".


== mystery science theater 3000 ==
war of the colossal beast was featured in season 3, episode 19 of mystery science theater 3000. the amazing colossal man was also shown in season 3. mike nelson again portrayed the film's title character. as opposed to his first encounter with joel and the bots, he shows more gentleness to them after seeing the transmission picked up by his "goofy dental work", but is still somewhat adamant when he tells them why bert i. gordon did not pick him for the sequel.
