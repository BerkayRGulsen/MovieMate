=== critical reception ===
m. suganth of the times of india gave 3.5/5 and said, "much of the credit for this (film) should go to director badri, whose script clearly suggests that some amount of thought has gone into reworking a cult classic for present-day audiences. instead of going for a scene by scene remake, he manages to spin newer situations that make it very much a film of our times."  in.com said, "thillu mullu is good fun while it lasts and enjoyable for shivas antics. any remakes success is when it makes us forget the original and this new thillu mullu does that well with different situations and a decent cast". behindwoods said, "the strong point of the film is definitely shiva and he suits the role of pasupathy and kandhan ganguly so effortlessly." indiaglitz said, "for diehard rajini lovers, who were a lot concerned about how this movie would fare off and will it do justice to the original, yes this has no way harmed the original indeed. if superstar's 'thillu mullu' was clean and a complete family entertainer, so is this remake." sify said, "thillu mullu on the whole is a laugh riot, go have your fun. the film, in the end, is a broad entertainer that plays to the gallery. keep your expectations in check, and you are sure to come out with a smile." the new indian express wrote, "breezy and fun-filled, thillu mullu keeps one entertained for the most part".on the other hand, s. saraswathi of rediff.com wrote that the film "fails to evoke spontaneous laughter and lacks the brilliance and rib-tickling humour of the original." zeenews.com too was critical of the film, "one of the glaring differences between the two versions is the treatment of comedy. while in the original it was sensible and funny, it is loud and commercial in the remake. despite a few rib-tickling moments between shiva and prakash raj, thillu mullu suffers due to extended running time and skewed screenplay." baradwaj rangan of the hindu wrote "the film, in its earlier avatar, was aided immensely by the eye-rolling eccentricities of thengai srinivasan, which is exactly whats needed when the hero is playing it straight. prakash raj, here, isnt allowed that kind of leeway  hes given nothing to work with. and things are made worse by a screenplay that moves in fits and starts, never building up steam. isnt there more to comedy than one-liners?
