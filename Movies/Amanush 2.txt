== critical reception ==
madhushree ghosh of the times of india reviewed "there are two reasons why you can spend one evening watching amanush 2 and not regret later  soham's impressive return after last year's golpo holeo sotti and a gripping storyline that keeps you glued to your seats till the end. thankfully, like most commercial bengali films, amanush 2 steers clear of the typical song and dance routine, an arm-candy heroine or a ruthless villain with a country's supply of weapons at his disposal. and if these don't excite you enough, the film has a brilliant anindya chatterjee (as raghu's friend ashok), who leaves a lasting impression once again after chotushkone. however, this film too has its share of flaws. it is predictable to a great extent, which takes away the charm of a thriller. paayel sarkar, as ashok's girlfriend riya, looks worn out. even her heavy make-up, trendy clothes couldn't camouflage her disinterested performance. otherwise, it is a good one-time watch."


== music ==
songs are composed by arindam chatterjee. one song (shotti ke mitthe bole sung by epr iyer) was retained from the song "thappelam thappe illai" from naan tamil soundtrack by vijay antony which was sung by hiphop tamizha & santhosh hariharan.
