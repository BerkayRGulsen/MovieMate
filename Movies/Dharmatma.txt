== plot ==
eknath (bal gandharva) concentrates on giving charitable and caring help to people especially those of the untouchable caste. this goes in variance against the vindictive mahant (chandra mohan) who opposes such practices. things come to a head when at a prayer meeting, eknath feeds the untouchables first, before the brahmins, as would be the normal custom. eknath does not differentiate between castes and eats at their house too. this enrages the mahant and he has eknath ex-communicated. eknath's son hari pandit (kale) has joined the people and the mahant who oppose his father's practices. eknath finally arrives at kashi and defends his behaviour by reciting verses of his poems to pradayananda shastri.

== production ==
sant eknath was the "only male role" enacted by bal ghandharva, who was a marathi stage "legend". the film had a bigger budget allocated to it than prabhat's sant tukaram (1936) made the following year. the original title mahatma had to be changed due to the censors objection. chandra mohan's character was given a "nervous tic in one eye" to make him appear as an ordinary villain, and for expressionistic purposes shantaram made use of "high-angle close-ups". dharmatma was one of the only four films made on caste system around that period. the others were chandidas (1932), chandidas (1934), and to a lesser extent achhut kanya (1936) which had a "contemporary setting".


== soundtrack ==
the music direction was by master krishnarao phulambrikar, a classical musician who combined with another classicist bal gandharva in the film to create "a milestone in indian cinema". the lyrics were by narottam vyas. there were sixteen songs in the film and the singers were bal gandharva, vasant desai, ratnaprabha, vasanti and master chhotu.
