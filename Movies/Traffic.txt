== plot ==
on 16 september, superstar sidharth shankar (rahman) gets ready for the release of his new film. on the same day, traffic constable sudevan (sreenivasan) joins back on duty, after having been suspended from service for taking bribe as he wanted to pay the fees for his niece's admission. the day is special for dr. abel (kunchako boban) who is celebrating his first wedding anniversary. raihan (vineeth sreenivasan), an aspiring television journalist, starts his first job with an interview with siddharth shankar the very same day.
on the same day, at a crowded traffic junction in kochi, raihan and rajeev (asif ali), travelling in a bike are fatally hit by a speeding car at the signal. raihan is all set to interview the superstar, siddharth shankar. also at the junction, in another car, is the surgeon dr. abel.
raihan goes into coma and is declared brain dead although he is kept alive using ventilator in lakeshore hospital kochi. meanwhile, siddharth's ailing daughter riya's (namitha pramod) condition becomes worse. she is admitted to ahalya hospital palakkad and she urgently needs a heart transplant. at first, raihan's parents do not agree to take their son off the ventilator and donate their son's heart but rajeev and raihan's girlfriend aditi (sandhya) persuade them into it. now that the heart is available, the problem was with transporting it from kochi to palakkad. no helicopters or chartered flights are available due to bad weather and time concerns and so the heart will have to be taken by road. someone will have to drive the 150 kilometres from lakeshore hospital in kochi to ahalya hospital in palakkad in under two hours during the rush traffic.
city police commissioner ajmal nazar (anoop menon) is asked to carry out the mission. he initially refuses considering the complexity and risk involved in the mission. but finally, he heeds to the persuasion of dr.simon d'souza (jose prakash). sudevan, being an experienced driver who has driven as an escort for ministers, volunteers to be the driver of the mahindra scorpio which will transport the heart because he wanted to regain the name he lost due to the bribe incident. accompanying him on this mission is dr abel and rajeev.
everything goes smoothly for some time. but at a point dr. abel threatens sudevan that he would kill rajeev if he didn't comply, forcing sudevan to deviate from the highway into a forest road (puttukad forest area) in order to save himself from the police. however, rajeev retaliates leading to a fight. he phones his sister miriam (roma) and speaks that he had hit his wife shwetha (remya nambeesan) with a car as he was infuriated with the fact that she was cheating on him with his best friend jikku (krishna) and that she has possibly died, so he wishes to save himself from the clutches of the police. here siddharth shankar phones him and convinces him that he can save abel, however, abel is shown not to be so convinced. in the nick of time,  shruti(lena), siddharth shankar's wife explains her mental traumatic condition due to the heart problem of her daughter for the last 13 years. and explains that no other problem can be bigger than this one. abel now convinced, advises sudevan and rajeev to leave. however, sudevan decides to have abel with them in the team and in spite of the repeated suggestions from the commissioner nazar to get him arrested. 
they are then shown to enter a road 8 km ahead of the route time table, thus making up for the time they lost in the forest. however, after some time riya's conditions worsen, forcing the team to take an alternate route through a communally sensitive place called bilal colony. it is shown that police cannot enter the place due to its strong minority.  rajeev seems to know the place well and advises siddharth shankar to get the place cleared for the vehicle to move. siddharth shankar personally phones thanzeer(baiju ezhuppuna) the fans club president who goes out of his ways and means to clear roads for the vehicle. rajeev exits the vehicle as soon as they enter the colony to ensure the roads are clear. in midway, abel also exits the vehicle to remove two vehicles which are blocking the route. after which abel boards the car with thanzeer's assistance, however, rajeev is unable to board the car. sudevan drives at high speeds and ensures that they reach ahalya hospital on time. covering the challenging 150 km feat in a daunting 1 hour and 58 minutes.  
it is shown that shwetha is out of danger and has no complaints regarding the accident against abel, thus freeing him. rajeev is offered a lift to kochi by an unnamed man (nivin pauly). raihan's parents invite aditi home as a symbol of acceptance and prepare for the last rites of raihan. riya opens her eyes, bringing joy to her family, nazar feels a sense of satisfaction and phones dr. simon d'souza to thank him. sudevan en route to his home finds a few people fighting on the road regarding a minor accident, where he signals them to stop the fight. thus the movie ends on a happy note.

traffic is one of the first multi narratives made in this decade in malayalam film. the film has sreenivasan, rahman, kunchacko boban and asif ali as the four lead protagonists whose stories are narrated through the sequences. vineeth sreenivasan, who recently made his debut as a writer and director with malarvadi arts club, says that it was the exciting script that attracted him to the project. "it is a particularly exciting day for my character as he is all set to join a news channel but as it turns out fate had other plans in store for him," adds the actor.
on the theme, rajesh says, "i felt it was a theme that could connect with viewers regardless of their age. it's a contemporary theme that reassures us that if we approach something with honesty, even nature will come to our support." the film will be the second on-screen pairing of vineeth and sreenivasan, after their first film makante achan. sandhya plays aditi, who is in love with raihan. "aditi is perhaps more worldly-wise than usual for someone her age. but she has her own reasons for being so", says the malayali actor who created quite a stir with her performance in the tamil film. this movie was said to be better than its other remakes.
