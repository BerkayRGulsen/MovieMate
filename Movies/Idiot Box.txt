idiot box is a 1996 australian film starring ben mendelsohn.
set in (around 1980's or 90's) middle class city urban australian youth and young adults culture with local criminal well to do's and widespread general unemployment. the story viewing is shown from the private and illicit side of the activity of friends turning to crime by personal circumstance, all the way to the nitty-gritty of sand-shoes and caring considerate criminals' sincerity. idiot box is another "era" australian "bank robber film" entwined with a wry sense of humour.


== plot ==
the story follows two fictional characters mick and kev who have nothing to offer. they are stereotypical bogans with a taste for cheap thrills. kev's hobby is being angry, his motto is "maximum fear, minimum time". he is unemployed with "attitude," an antagonistic manner. mick is his best friend ("mate") and together they kill time drinking beer, watching the idiot box and looking for action on the street.
one day kev tells mick they have drawn their last dole cheque. instead of giving into their limited circumstances, they are going to get rich quick doing the only thing they are qualified for - crime. conning a friend into driving the getaway car, the gang of three plan a bank robbery. but it is a heist that is doomed from the start when professional criminals target the same bank.


== production ==
the film's writer-director david caesar said:

i think that idiot box is about two young men who are doing the best they can with the resources available to them. now, the fact that the resource available, as far as they're concerned, is robbing a bank doesn't change the fact that it's still about them trying, basically not giving up. i'm surprised that people haven't come down on me for saying, 'oh, this is going to promote people robbing banks.' the issue with the film, from my point of view, is that it was about people who hadn't given in to their circumstances.


== box office ==
idiot box grossed $837,689 at the box office in australia.
