== reception ==


=== critical response ===
the new york times gave the film a mixed review, "playgirl, at the mayfair, is a routine, unconvincing case history about some of new york's plushier pitfalls. shelley winters, barry sullivan and a newcomer named colleen miller head the cast of this universal-international drama that for all its pretensions of sophisticated insight seems as old and familiar as the very hills ... inspired performances could hardly be expected from such contrived material, although the blees scenario provides a smattering of pungent dialogue and one fine, ugly encounter between a sadistic restaurateur and a society weakling."
