one evening at the resort, he is shocked and surprised to know that nandini is staying at the neighbouring cottage. he also learns that she is now an internationally acclaimed writer, and that she is still single, not having married anyone. after the initial hesitant moments, they gradually share their life stories, and gradually the old balettan-nandinikutty bond of yesteryear is revived. due to eanashu's influence on him, he has also slowly erased raji from his mind.
