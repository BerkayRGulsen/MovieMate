== illusion-o ==
as with several of his more famous productions, castle used a gimmick to promote 13 ghosts. audience members were given a choice: the "brave" ones could watch the film and see the ghosts in 3d.
in the theaters most scenes were black-and-white, but scenes involving ghosts were shown in a "process" dubbed "illusion-o." the filmed elements of the actors and the sets  everything except the ghosts  had a blue filter applied to the footage, while the ghost elements had a red filter and were superimposed over the frame. audiences received viewers with red and blue cellophane filters. unlike early 3d glasses, where one eye is red and the other is cyan or blue, the illusion-o viewer required people to look through a single color with both eyes. choosing to look through the red filter intensified the images of the ghosts, while the blue filter "removed" them.television and home video releases are edited to simulate the effect without the need for special glasses.


== reception ==
howard thompson of the new york times called the film "a simple, old-fashioned haunted house yarn" that "would be a lot better off without this gimmick." variety wrote, "the idea is sound and exploitable, but the execution doesn't fully come off," explaining the ghosts "lack personality and aren't frightening, so that there isn't sufficient tension in the sequences during which the 'ghost viewer' comes into play." the monthly film bulletin called it "a workmanlike but not very frightening horror film ... the ghosts, which are a dull red colour, are far less effective when witnessed than when their presence is merely suggested, especially when their viewability depends on a process as unremarkable as illusion-o."


== remake ==
the film was remade in 2001 with a spelled-out title, thirteen ghosts, and was directed by steve beck. like the original, the film was distributed by columbia pictures, except in the united states and canada, where it was distributed by warner bros. pictures.
