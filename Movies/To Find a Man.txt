rosalind mccarthy is a spoiled 16-year-old who returns home to new york city from boarding school for the holidays. she confides to a friend, andy, that she might be pregnant.
they seek out the advice of dr. katchaturian, a pharmacist. rosalind naively tries to induce a miscarriage by jumping, drinking castor oil, even douching with soda pop. resigned to an abortion before a family vacation in mexico, she needs money.
andy tries to get some from the baby's father, rick, a gigolo with whom rosalind had a one-night stand. he fails, so he pawns a chemistry set, only to be mugged and robbed on the way home.
in desperation, andy goes to rosalind's father, pretending he needs to borrow money for someone he has impregnated. frank mccarthy obliges, but when he concludes that rosalind is the one who needs the abortion, he orders andy never to return to their house. dr. hargrave performs the abortion, after which rosalind cavalierly offers andy sex as her way of a thank-you.
