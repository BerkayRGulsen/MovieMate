== reception ==
sify wrote "strictly for those who love double entendre, crude comedy, skin show and item numbers, flying kicks and have more than two and a half hours to spare". behindwoods wrote "the storyline is nothing new and it rides on a very predictable path. [..] there are no twists and turns and the movie travels on a beaten path". rediff wrote "the problem is, there's nothing in the least respectable about the movie. you can enjoy a well-paced potpourri that at least tries to entertain everyone, but there's little to the credit of a film that seriously tests the boundaries of vulgarity and makes you squirm in your seat with embarrassment".
