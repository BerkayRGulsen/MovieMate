== production ==
the film was the directorial debut of craig rosenberg, an australian writer who had been making a living writing screenplays in los angeles. david parker was producer. rosenberg:

working with david parker was an absolute joy. he's so experienced; he has written, produced and shot feature movies. to have him as producer on my first feature was a remarkable luxury for me because, if i had a writing problem, i could throw it to him and say, `what do you think about this? read this page for me'. if i had some shooting problem i would say, `what do you think about this?' as well as having him do his normal production responsibilities. so he was a real godsend. he was a dream and he's a lovely person and i think we've formed a long friendship out of the experience.
