"texas" grant (tim mccoy) rides into a strange town only to find that everyone there recognizes him, but not as texas grant. the town villains confuse him with a lawman named jim rawlings whom they had murdered a few years prior, because the two men look very similar. hefty the bartender and sheriff collins used to be friends with rawlings and come up with a plan to fool the local crooks into thinking grant really is the man they killed. even helen, the dead lawman's widow, thinks her husband's returned from the grave when she first sees him. 
grant sees how the woman's ranch hands are mismanaging the ranch her husband left her and are even stealing from her, and decides to help her get the place back to financial solvency. appointing himself the new boss and adopting the identity of jim rawlings, he fires all but one of the ranch hands, an honest young man named steve pickett (john wayne), and together grant and pickett try to help the widow rebuild her enterprise.
