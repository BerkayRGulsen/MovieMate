== production ==
the idea and script for the film was written by norman thaddeus vane, which author simon richter believes was the key force behind the film. vane's script has been suggested to be somewhat autobiographical, as it mirrors the author's own marriage to 16 year-old model sarah caldwell, whom he married in the mid-1960s when he was 38. the title song and two other original numbers are composed and performed by jim dale.


== reception ==
the contemporary north american film directors: a wallflower critical guide state that the film exploited "the sexual freedom of its era", describing susan george's character as a "naive young nymphet".
