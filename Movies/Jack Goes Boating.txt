== plot ==
jack (philip seymour hoffman) is a shy limousine driver who lives with and works for his uncle. his best friend and co-worker clyde (john ortiz) and clyde's wife lucy (daphne rubin-vega) set up a dinner date at their house with lucy's new co-worker, connie (amy ryan), who has intimacy issues of her own.
as jack and connie get to know each other, he sets his sights on learning to swim so he can take her boating when summer comes; with clyde eager to help him learn, they begin swimming lessons. jack soon decides that summer is too far away to wait for a date with connie, so he decides that a nice dinner would be a good place to start. when connie says that no one has ever cooked a meal for her, jack decides that he wants to be the chef and cook for her. this adds another set of lessons to be learned as jack does not know how to cook, so clyde sets jack up with a chef friend of lucy's to learn the culinary art form.
as jack strives to perfect swimming and cooking, he begins to get a look behind the veil of the marriage of his friends, which is straining under the weight of mutual occasional infidelities. as the troubles of their marriage become increasingly apparent, jack and connie grow closer: her general mistrust gradually erodes, and he gains confidence and skill in relating to her and in pursuing his dream job. the film's last scene has jack and connie walking off happily, as a newly single clyde looks on ambivalently.
