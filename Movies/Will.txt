== evaluation of the year ==
richard brody of the new yorker observed that the best films of 2011 "exalt the metaphysical, the fantastical, the transformative, the fourth-wall-breaking, or simply the impossible, andremarkablydo so ... these films depart from 'reality' ... not in order to forget the irrefutable but in order to face it, to think about it, to act on it more freely". film critic and filmmaker scout tafoya of rogerebert.com considers the year of 2011 as the best year for cinema, countering the notion of 1939 being film's best year overall, citing examples such as drive, the tree of life, once upon a time in anatolia, keyhole, contagion, the adventures of tintin, and sherlock holmes: a game of shadows. he stated that "2011 housed not just some of the greatest art films of our age, but a revolution in the language of blockbuster filmmaking. one big-budget action film after another used digital cameras to show the world behind explosions in starker, stranger light, while constructing a backbone of classical ideas and images."
