sakigake!! otokojuku (japanese: !!, lit. "charge! men's private school"), also known as simply otokojuku, is a japanese manga series written and illustrated by akira miyashita. it was originally serialized at the weekly shnen jump from 1985 to 1991. it is staged in an all-boys school that teaches how to be true men. the students are trained to "revive the spirit of japan" and mainly engage in events where they will polish their manhood and push through with their guts.


== plot ==

the genius principal of the private school, heihachi edajima, was a war hero during world war ii. he trained his students to play an active role in politics, economics and industries in japan and all over the world, though the way of training is highly anachronistic.
the martial arts depicted in this series are also highly choreographed using various forms of martial arts.


== story ==


=== early gag manga arc ===
the strongest of the otokojuku first years, momotaro tsurugi, while enduring and overcoming the strict training of the malicious instructors and the second years, resolves the problems of the other first years with wisdom, kindness, and a manly spirit.


=== kyoura daiyon kyousatsu arc ===
the budget of otokojuku falls into the red, so edajima devises to throw the gakuensai () festival in order to collect profits. however just as the festival reaches a climax, omito date and his kanto gogakuren attack. when they are unable to settle the dispute through otokojuku's specialty matches, edajima suggests the kyoura daiyon kyousatsu (, the 4 great astonishing assaults). date and the gogakuren agree and the battles take place on the sacred mt. fuji.

after the pa-lien seiha is ended, momo and the gang are called to the headmaster's room. there they are shown a war film about how the us army discovered a skillfully disguised japanese army secret base and destroyed it. when some of the students doubt this, edajima tells them of a man who held a position in the us army. that man's name was takemitsu isa, now known as hyoei todo. the students now wish to attack this inhuman todo, so they participate in tenchou gorin dai bukai (, challenge the heavens olympics great tournament) which he sponsors.


=== battle of the seven tusks arc ===
one month after the tenchou gorin, momo and the gang welcome the newly enrolled students. during momo's fight over his title as representative with new first year souji togo, an incident occurs in the headmaster's room. despite his overwhelming fighting power, edajima suffers a defeat before a capture gun strong enough to take down an elephant. he is kidnapped and his assailants escape into the air. the students then set out for the battle of the seven tusks (, batoru obu sebun tasukusu) in order to rescue edajima.


=== fuun rakanjuku arc ===
edajima's lifelong rival kinzo kumada creates another otokojuku called fu'un rakanjuku (, wind and clouds arhat private school), and as they agreed upon three years ago, otokojuku and rakanjuku compete against each other in the go konsen (, 5 spirit transitions) match.
