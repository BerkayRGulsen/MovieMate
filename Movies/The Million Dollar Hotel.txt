== production ==
the story was originally developed by bono in 1987 when filming the music video for "where the streets have no name". 


== reception ==
the movie had an estimated budget of $8 million, but opened to only $29,483 in us box office, with little more success in subsequent weeks or in other countries. it also received very poor reviews, obtaining 25 of 100 on metacritic and 25% on rotten tomatoes, although it won the silver bear at the berlin international film festival in 2000. in an october 2000 press conference in sydney, before the australian release of the film, mel gibson said, "i thought it was as boring as a dog's ass." he later explained:

it was at the end of a day where i had done 6,000 interviews, some guy was ragging on the film and it just slipped out. later, i thought 'god, why did i say that? i'm an idiot! i produced this film. i'm distributing it!' it was pretty thoughtless of me, because a lot of people worked very hard on that film, and the fact is there are moments of genius in it. the soundtrack is by u2, and it's phenomenal. so i really regret saying that. i have written a lot of apology letters about it.
