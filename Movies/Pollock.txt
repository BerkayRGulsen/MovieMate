== plot ==
the film opens in medias res to abstract expressionist painter jackson pollock, autographing a copy of life magazine for a woman at his 1950 art exhibit.
nine years earlier, pollock exhibits paintings in occasional group art shows. he lives with his brother, sande, and sister-in-law, arloie, in a tiny new york apartment. arloie says she and sande are expecting a baby, hinting that pollock should move out. soon afterward, pollock meets and takes an interest in artist lee krasner. he learns later that his brother has taken a job in connecticut building military gliders to avoid the draft. pollock goes on a drinking binge and is found in a disheveled state by sande and lee. sande tells lee that pollock has been diagnosed as "clinically neurotic". lee takes him home and becomes his manager.
one day, pollock's old friend, reuben kadish, visits, bringing along howard putzel, who works for wealthy art collector, peggy guggenheim. after guggenheim views his work, he is given a contract to exhibit his paintings, plus a commission to paint a 8 ft by 20 ft mural in her new york townhouse entry way. pollock's first exhibit fails to attract any buyers. after a new year's eve party, pollock almost sleeps with peggy, but is too drunk. he falls into another drunken stupor upon hearing that putzel has died. 
pollock and lee are wed after lee says they either marry or "split up". after they move to long island, pollock is dismayed that lee does not want children. at a get-together at peggy's, pollock dismisses art critic clement greenberg's comments, and refuses to change his painting style to be more marketable. pollock's paintings are not selling, but clement assures him it will change after a life article about him is published and his upcoming exhibit. lee and pollock's marriage is strained after he openly flirts with another woman. meanwhile, to earn income, pollock tries various occupations but fails due to his alcoholism. he lies to sande about his financial status, though this improves after the life story about him is published. later, hans namuth films pollock as he paints, though namuth's presence interrupts the spontaneous nature of pollock's work. pollock, who tried abstaining from alcohol, begins drinking again and ruins thanksgiving dinner.
five years after the 1950 exhibit, clement tells pollock that the partisan review is favoring artist clyfford still, and says his original technique could be the next direction of modern art. a drunk pollock reacts badly, and becomes even angrier when lee berates him for his drinking and womanizing. pollock blames lee because she will not have a child. lee knows about his affair with ruth kligman, but refuses to divorce jackson. in 1956, lee calls pollock while she is in venice. after, he tells ruth, "i owe the woman something". on a subsequent visit, ruth brings along her friend, edith. the three go for a drive, but pollock is drunk and crashes the car, killing himself and edith, and throwing ruth from the car, seriously injuring her.
