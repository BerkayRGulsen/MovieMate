== reception ==
for his performance, michael douglas was nominated for golden globe award for new star of the year  actor.upon the film's october 1969 release, vincent canby wrote:
in hail, hero! you can see kirk douglas, even younger than he was in the champion in 1949, in the person of his 25-year-old son, michael. this new douglas has his father's extraordinary, fearless fosdick jaw, the suggestion of his dimpled chin and the cool, gentle eyes. he also possesses the almost manic, physical buoyancy that compels attention even when it bears little relation to the circumstances in which the actor finds himself. it's not an especially memorable performance, but it's an energetic one, and without douglas, hail, hero! would not even be tolerable.
in a retrospective review tv guide called it a "talky, uninspired attempt to bring 60s-style 'relevance' to the screen."
