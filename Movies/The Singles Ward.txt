== the singles ward ==
the singles ward is a 2002 romantic comedy film, based on moyer's life as a stand-up comedian and single member of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds church).  like the r.m., and other lds cinema that followed it, the singles ward's target audience is members of the lds church and citizens of utah. the film follows jonathan jordan, a recently divorced latter-day saint stand-up comedian who has not practiced his faith in several years, when he meets an active latter-day saint woman who changes his perspective.


=== plot ===
after faithfully serving a full-time mission for the lds church and marrying, jordan finds himself divorced and once again a member of the lds single adult world.  he attends a "singles ward", a congregation specifically for unmarried adults, where the ultimate goal is eternal marriage.  disenchanted, jordan stops going to church.  he even creates a standup routine lampooning the mormon lifestyle.  his resistance to the church continues until he falls for cammie giles, a member of the local singles ward.  suddenly, jordan finds going to church more appealing, but is he attending church again just to impress her?  during the course of the movie, jonathan frequently breaks the fourth wall to narrate events to the audience.
