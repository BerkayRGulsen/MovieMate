the next day, the police cannot find the naked woman or hugh, who was living under a false identity. at school, jaime sees an old woman in a hospital gown walking towards her, invisible to others. jaime's sister, kelly (sepe) and her friends, paul bolduan (gilchrist) and yara davis (luccardi), agree to help and spend the night in jaime and kelly's house. that night, someone smashes the kitchen window; paul investigates but sees no one. inside the house, jaime sees a disheveled, urinating, half-naked woman walking toward her and runs upstairs to the others, who cannot see the entity. when a tall man enters the bedroom, jaime flees the house; her friends catch up to her at a nearby playground.
with the help of their neighbor, greg hannigan (zovatto), the group discovers hugh's real name  jeff redmond  and traces him to his address. jeff's mother (ruby harris) answers the door and jaime realizes that the naked woman she had seen coming for her in the packard plant was in the form of mrs. redmond. jeff explains that the entity began pursuing him after a one-night stand and that jaime can pass it on by having sex with someone else. greg drives jaime, kelly, yara and paul to his family's lake house and teaches jaime to shoot a revolver. the entity arrives in the form of yara and attacks jaime on the lakefront. jaime's friends ward it off by breaking a chair over its body and jaime shoots it in the head, but it recovers unharmed and attacks jaime again, this time taking the form of a boy who lives next door to jaime. she flees in greg's car, crashes into a cornfield and wakes up in a hospital with a broken arm. greg has sex with jaime in the hospital, as he does not believe the entity exists.

== development and production ==
writer and director david robert mitchell conceived the film based on recurring dreams he had in his youth about being followed: "i didn't use those images for the film, but the basic idea and the feeling i used. from what i understand, it's an anxiety dream. whatever i was going through at that time, my parents divorced when i was around that age, so i imagine it was something to do with that." the role that sexual transmission plays came later, from mitchell's desire for something that could transfer between people. mitchell started writing the film in 2011 while working on a separate film he intended to be his second feature film; however, mitchell struggled with this would-be second feature and made it follows as his next film instead. mitchell realized that the concept he was working on was tough to describe and thus refused to discuss the plot when asked what he was working on, reasoning later, "when you say it out loud, it sounds like the worst thing ever." the film was shot in late 2013 in detroit, michigan. mitchell used wide-angle lenses when filming to give the film an expansive look, and cited the works of george romero and john carpenter as influences on the film's compositions and visual aesthetic. the film's monster, shot composition and overall aesthetic were influenced by the work of contemporary photographer gregory crewdson. director of photography mike gioulakis said: "we're both big fans of the still photographer gregory crewdson and david had him in his look book from day one. [crewdson's] photographs have the same kind of surreal suburban imagery that we wanted for it follows."


== interpretations ==
it follows has sparked numerous interpretations from film critics in regard to the source of "it" and the film's symbolism. critics have interpreted the film as a parable about hiv/aids, other sexually transmitted infections and the social perceptions thereof; the sexual revolution; and "primal anxieties" about intimacy. mitchell stated: "i'm not personally that interested in where 'it' comes from. to me, it's dream logic in the sense that they're in a nightmare, and when you're in a nightmare there's no solving the nightmare. even if you try to solve it." mitchell said that while jaime "opens herself up to danger through sex, the one way in which she can free herself from that danger... we're all here for a limited amount of time and we can't escape our mortality... but love and sex are two ways in which we can at least temporarily push death away."
