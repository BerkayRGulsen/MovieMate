the film opens with the disclosure by morgue examiners that a beautiful woman has literally died of fright. the plot reveals how she reached the fatal stage of terror.
the woman is married to the son of a doctor, the proprietor of a private sanatorium, where she is under unwilling treatment.  both the son and the doctor indicate they want the marriage dissolved. arriving at the scene is a mysterious personage (bela lugosi) identified as the doctor's cousin who had been a stage magician in europe.  he is accompanied by a threatening dwarf (angelo rossitto).
after it is apparent that the wife is terrified of the foreigners, it is disclosed that she is the former wife and stage partner of a paris magician known as ren, who was believed to have been shot by the nazis. attempts to draw a confession that she had betrayed her magician husband and had collaborated with the nazis led to the use of a device employing a death mask of the supposedly dead patriot, which literally frightens her to death.
