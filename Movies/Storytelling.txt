storytelling premiered at the 2001 cannes film festival on may 12, 2001 before receiving a limited north american theatrical release on january 25, 2002.


=== red box controversy ===
during the sex scene in the fiction entry, a "red box" was added for the american version of the film, blocking the audience's view of a rough sex scene between blair and wisdom. this was used to bend the rules of the mpaa's rating system, allowing the film to obtain the r rating instead of nc-17. the box is not present in the international version of the film, although in the american dvd release, both options are available.


=== box office ===
the film earned $73,688 in its opening weekend in a mere four venues, ranking number 42 in the domestic box office. by the end of its run, on march 28, 2002, the film grossed $921,445 domestically and $397,500 overseas for a worldwide total of $1,318,945.


=== critical reception ===
the film received mixed reviews from critics. review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reports a 53% approval rating based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 5.59/10. the site's critics consensus reads: "todd solondz's storytelling boasts an audacious narrative structure, but fails to deliver on the mechanics of its namesake, yielding a creative exercise that is more interested in satisfying the author's interests rather than the audience's involvement." on metacritic, the film has a 50 out of 100 rating based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
