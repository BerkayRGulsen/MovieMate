spring reunion is a 1957 american film that centers on the fifteen-year reunion of the fictional carson high school class of 1941.
spring reunion was a screen comeback for betty hutton, her first film in five years since she had left paramount studios in 1952 after finishing the musical somebody loves me. although hutton's performance was praised by several critics, the film generated little interest and failed at the box office. it was hutton's last feature film.

maggie brewster (betty hutton), once voted the most popular girl in her class, has a successful real estate career, but regrets that she never married. when she runs into an old flame at the reunion (dana andrews), it looks as if the two might be meant for each other after all. however, dana's aversion to commitment and maggie's unwillingness to step out of her comfort zone threaten to kill their romance before it begins.

== reception ==
writing in the new york times, contemporary reviewer a. h. weiler panned the film, saying, "although it fleetingly captures the loneliness of some of its principals, it is largely a nostalgia-ridden and unimaginative comedy-drama that makes its points haltingly and without impact. like the members of carson high school's class of '41, 'spring reunion' tries desperately but fails to make its rosy dreams come alive."
