=== critical response ===
on rotten tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 33 critics, with an average rating of 6.19/10. on metacritic it has a score of 53% based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".janet maslin of the new york times said that the film "isn't much more than a glorified sitcom, but it's funny, and it's liable to hit home." kevin thomas of the los angeles times said that the filmmakers were "not afraid to be sophisticated and screwballish in the best '30s tradition, and they know just how far to exaggerate for laughs without leaving touch with reality entirely or destroying sentiment. the humor in baby boom is sharp without being heartless." roger ebert gave the film three out of four stars, stating that "all of [the film's storyline] is too good to be true, of course, but that's why i enjoyed it." "baby boom makes no effort to show us real life. it is a fantasy about mothers and babies and sweetness and love, with just enough wicked comedy to give it an edge. the screenplay, written by producer nancy meyers and director charles shyer, has some of the same literate charm as their previous film, irreconcilable differences, and some of the same sly observation of a generation that wages an interior war between selfishness and good nature."keaton's performance was singled out by pauline kael from the new yorker, who described it as "a glorious comedy performance that rides over many of the inanities in this picture (...) keaton is smashing: the tiger lady's having all this drive is played for farce and keaton keeps you alert to every shade of pride and panic the character feels. she's an ultra-feminine executive, a wide-eyed charmer, with a breathless ditziness that may remind you of jean arthur in the more the merrier."baby boom's writers combat a one-dimensional review in which american journalist, writer, and university professor caryn james expresses her distaste in j.c. "abandon[ing] a high-powered manhattan career for the joys of life in vermont with a baby and sam shepard." the article, published on august 13, 1989, by the new york times, explains how j.c.'s search for equality prompted her to leave her elite new york position. according to its writers, baby boom depicts "the increasing prejudice women face today" stereotyped into two categories  the sweet caregiver or the self-reliant businesswoman  and aims to destroy that outdated mindset.
