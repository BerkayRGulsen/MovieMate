the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reported an approval rating of 54% with an average score of 5.1/10, based on 102 reviews. the website's critical consensus reads, "in think like a man, an otherwise standard rom-com is partially elevated by a committed -- and attractive -- cast, resulting in a funny take on modern romance."  metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 51 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews."roger ebert of the chicago sun-times wrote that a major problem with the film is that it takes seriously the advice given in the book it is based upon, commenting that such an approach "might have worked as a screwball comedy or a satire, but can you believe for a moment in characters naive enough to actually live their lives following steve harvey's advice? the result is a tiresome exercise that circles at great length through various prefabricated stories defined by the advice each couple needs (or doesn't need)." ebert called the cast "superb" noting in particular the performances of meagan good and kevin hart. owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly also complimented good and hart's performance, as well as romany malco's performance. he ultimately gave the film a "b-" grade, writing that it is "so busy tracking courtship as if it were a science project that the bite-size love stories lack spontaneity." in a positive review, michael phillips of the chicago tribune commended the film for "stick[ing] to a formula without falling prey to it" and commented that "its hangout factor is considerable, because the actors' charms are considerable."
