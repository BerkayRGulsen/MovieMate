== plot ==
the roberts family farm in iowa is a prosperous one. frank roberts, sr. and his two young sons are even visited there by nikita khrushchev during the soviet union premier's tour of the midwestern united states.
many years later, the boys are grown but their dad's pride and joy has fallen into disrepair and debt. a deluge of rain has ruined the crops. they must resort to desperate measures, even a yard sale, just to pay their bills. the anger of frank jr. builds until he ultimately suggests to younger brother terry that they set fire to the farm, rather than let the bank seize control of it.
as the brothers take to the road, becoming thieves, the story of their action at home strikes a chord with neighbors and strangers who offer them shelter or even a hideout when the law's in pursuit. along the way, the roberts brothers encounter a wide variety of people, including maxwell, a reporter who wants to tell their story before the inevitable tragic consequences can occur.
