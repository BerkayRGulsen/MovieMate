== plot ==
bala (shaam) is the favorite hit man of gangster pasupathi (rajan p. dev). when bala is not zooming around in jeeps with a wild-looking gang parading down lanes with the same gang faithfully following a step behind him or knocking down one person or another, he is successfully wooing aarthi (meera jasmine). aarthi is the daughter of jeyamani (raghuvaran), a rival gangster. ailing don paranthaman (thilakan), the mentor of the two rivals, brings a compromise by suggesting that aarthi will be married to pasupathi's wayward son. bala naturally becomes a pariah in both camps, until all's well that ends well.
