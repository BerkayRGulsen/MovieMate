== critical reception ==
richard nilsen, film critic for the arizona republic, liked the film at times, but gave the film a mixed review.  he wrote, "it does build up considerable suspense and tension; renfroe has learned well from hitchcock. and the final confrontation builds to a harrowing pitch. but that can't rescue the film from a silly, melodramatic finish."gabe hassan (played by actor khaled abol naga, who is a star in his native egypt, perhaps the most handsome would-be modern day terrorist ever) gives an inspired performance as the terrorist / grad student who challenges the lunatic (peter krause) that has him captive and effectively glides over a range of emotions
