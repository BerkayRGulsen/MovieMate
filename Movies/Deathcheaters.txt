the film was funded by the australian film commission, channel 9 and d.l. taffner. it was intended to be a pilot for a tv series that could be shown theatrically in australia and sold to television outside.it was shot in 16mm and blown up to 35mm for theatrical release. trenchard smith had worked with stuntman grant page several times and gave him his first lead role here. he also cast his wife, margaret gerard, as the female lead.trenchard smith says the movie went $7,000 over budget.


== release ==
the film performed disappointingly in australia theatrically. it had a presale to channel nine for $50,000, overseas sales of $40,000 and local rentals of $30,000, so made $120,000. in 1979 trenchard-smith was still confident the film would be profitable.(in 1977 antony i. ginnane claimed the film netted $130,000 in overseas sales.)


== reception ==
on rotten tomatoes, andrew l. urban of urban cinefile positively commented "nobody in their right minds would do it again, not with real actors today not even with stuntmen. unmissable!"
