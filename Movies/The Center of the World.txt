== plot ==
a couple checks into a suite in las vegas. flashbacks show that he's a computer whiz on the verge of becoming a dot-com millionaire (peter sarsgaard). she's a lap dancer at a club (molly parker). he's depressed, withdrawing from work, missing meetings with investors. he wants a connection, so he offers her $10,000 to spend three nights with him in vegas. she accepts with conditions: four hours per night of erotic play, and no penetration.
during the days in vegas, they get to know each other, have fun, and meet a friend of hers, casino dealer jerri (carla gugino). after the first night, things get complicated. when the three days are over, the stripper makes it clear that she was only there for the money and that the man she spent the time with was just a client. upset that his feelings aren't reciprocated, he rapes her; she makes no attempt to stop him. she then masturbates for him, achieving orgasm, saying "you want to see real? i'll show you real." the next day he returns home heartbroken.
the movie ends with his return to the strip club to see the woman he fell in love with again. she greets him fondly but interacts with him the way she had when they first met: as a stripper and a client ordering a lap dance.
because the film is shown in a non-linear format, it is left to the viewer to interpret the ending. one could believe that the film ends with the meeting at the strip club and a chance for the two characters to have a real relationship together, or one could believe that the strip club meeting occurred earlier in time and the film ends with the characters going their separate ways in life.
