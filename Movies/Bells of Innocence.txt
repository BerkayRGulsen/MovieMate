== plot ==
jux jonas (mike norris) is a man whose faith in god hangs by a thread. his daughter was hit and killed by a car, and he's spent the last few years "tearing through life", not wanting to face the pain and return to his faith. reluctantly, he journeys with friends conrad (david a. r. white) and oren (carey scott) aboard a plane to mexico, to hand out bibles as a form of ministry. however, their small aircraft soon crashes, and the trio find themselves in the secluded wasteland of ceres, a town where the citizens are pale and eerie, and visitors are seen as unwanted outsiders.
before long, jux and his pals discover something very weird in this place: no communication to the outside world seems to exist until local rancher matthew (chuck norris) offers him the use of his two-way radio. the town at large despises matthew and what he stands for. it's soon revealed that town elder joshua (marshall r. teague) is actually an agent of satan who has controlled the children of ceres for centuries to bring about an unholy war. god has sent matthew to observe, protect, and lead broken believers like jux back to their faith in jesus christ. as the forces of evil prepare for a spiritual armageddon, using the town's children as terrifying hosts, even matthew cannot interfere alone, and jux, conrad and oren must choose which side they will stand with...for all eternity.
