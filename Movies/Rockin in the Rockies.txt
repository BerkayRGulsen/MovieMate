== full-length feature films ==
joe besser never appeared with the stooges in a feature film.
three feature-length columbia releases were actually packages of older columbia shorts. columbia laff hour (introduced in 1956) was a random assortment that included the stooges among other columbia comedians like andy clyde, hugh herbert, and vera vague; the content and length varied from one theater to the next. three stooges fun-o-rama (introduced in 1959) was an all-stooges show capitalizing on their tv fame, again with shorts chosen at random for individual theaters. the three stooges follies (1974) was similar to laff hour, with a trio of stooge comedies augmented by buster keaton and vera vague shorts, a batman serial chapter, and a kate smith musical.
