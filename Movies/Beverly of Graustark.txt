== production ==
in her 22nd film, marion davies starred in yet another dual role as the american beverly calhoun who masquerades as her cousin oscar, who happens to be the prince of graustark, a small european monarchy. this was the second time that davies masqueraded as a male (see little old new york), and critics and audiences applauded the effort. the film is often cited as davies' most profitable film because of low production costs and big box office. the only problem in filming was davies' 10-day bout with the flu. this was her first teaming with antonio moreno, who played the royal bodyguard. the film boasted a 2-strip technicolor finale (which survives). davies' severe haircut, dubbed the "beverly bob," caused a fashion craze.
