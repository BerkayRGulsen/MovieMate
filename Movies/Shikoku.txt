== reception ==
jasper sharp writing for midnight eye referred to the film as a "pedestrian addition to the late 1990s horror boom.", finding it "hideo nakata's high-concept popcorn movie ring had proven pretty convincingly that the supernatural could be a lucrative cash cow in late-1990s recessional japan. a contract job, co-written by one of ring's original producers, takenori sento, and circulating on the lower half of a double bill with ring 2, shikoku is less an indication of either bando or nagasaki's thematic interests than an obvious attempt to milk the current interest in horror before it dried up. as such, it doesn't deviate too far from the path forged by its model in either style or formula. john kenneth muir in his book horror films of the 1990s gave the film a three and a half star rating out of five, finding the film "beautifully shot and visually realized" and that the film had "more on its mind than scary dead girls with long hair"
