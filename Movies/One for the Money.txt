== plot ==
in the chambersburg neighborhood of trenton, new jersey, stephanie plum is divorced and out of work. seeking a job at her cousin vinnie's bail bonds business, she blackmails him into letting her become a bail enforcement agent and tracks down fugitive joe morelli, her high school ex-boyfriend who has skipped his $500,000 bail. morelli escapes the inexperienced stephanie, who turns to veteran bounty hunter ricardo ranger manoso for help. explaining that morelli, a vice detective, is wanted for the murder of heroin dealer ziggy kulesza, ranger buys stephanie a gun.
police officer eddie gazarra, stephanie's friend, informs her that morelli shot ziggy at the apartment of prostitute carmen sanchez; though morelli claimed to act in self-defense, no evidence can be found that ziggy had a gun, and carmen and another man at the apartment have disappeared. stephanie befriends a prostitute named lula, who points her to a boxing gym where she questions cage fighter benito ramirez, carmens boyfriend, and his manager jimmy alpha. before ramirez can assault her, she is rescued by morelli, who reveals that carmen was his informant and suspects ramirez is responsible for her disappearance.
stephanie receives a threatening call from ramirez, and commandeers morellis car after searching his apartment. desperate for money, she recovers her first fugitive, delivering her nudist neighbor to the police for failure to appear. in the shower, she is confronted by morelli and left handcuffed and naked, forcing her to call ranger for help. she visits carmens apartment and meets john cho, a neighbor who witnessed the shooting. he explains that he knocked morelli unconscious, after which a flat-nosed guy fled the apartment. after capturing another fugitive, who first steals her gun and shoots at ranger, stephanie learns that cho has been killed.
she is tailed by ramirez, who leaves lula badly beaten outside stephanies apartment. morelli asks for stephanies help in clearing his name, in exchange for sole credit and payment for his capture, and she agrees, allowing him to lay low at her apartment. vinnies regular recovery agent morty beyers arrives to take over morellis bounty, and steals the keys to morellis car, but is killed in a car bomb intended for stephanie, and carmens apartment building is fire-bombed. wearing a wire so morelli can track her movements from nearby, stephanie spots the flat-nosed man at a butcher shop frequented by ziggy. the man loads two barrels onto a truck, and stephanie follows him and the butcher to a marina, where she and morelli discover the butchers boat is being used to transport heroin.
hearing gunshots, they find the flat-nosed man and the butcher shot dead in the truck, and carmens body in one of the barrels. they are attacked by ramirez and subdue him, but are held at gunpoint by jimmy alpha. he admits that he, ramirez, and ziggy were selling heroin, and killed carmen for informing on them to morelli; at carmens apartment, ziggy did try to kill morelli, but the flat-nosed man fled with ziggys gun. stephanie manages to shoot jimmy dead, but locks morelli in the truck and delivers him to the police, along with her covert recording of jimmys confession, which exonerates morelli. she collects the $50,000 bounty for morelli, who arrives at her door, and they rekindle their relationship.

=== reception ===
the film was not initially screened for critics and was widely panned. on rotten tomatoes, it holds a 2% approval rating based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 3.1/10. the site's consensus reads: "dull and unfunny, one for the money wastes katherine heigl's talents on a stunningly generic comic thriller." metacritic reported an average score of 22 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".r. kurt osenlund of slant magazine criticized the cartoonish portrayal of new jersey and its various caricatures, and the dumbed-down gender depiction of its main cast by an all-female production team, saying that, "this isn't girl-power filmmaking, this is cutesy contentment, a production team of gals enforcing their own stereotypes by willfully succumbing to demographic views of sexist hollywood honchos." sheri linden of the los angeles times noted the film's poor scripting of heigl's character, story progression, and balancing both screwball and black comedy, calling it "an ungainly mix of flat-footed gumshoeing and strained attempts at hilarity, all delivered with an unconvincing joizy vibe." kimberley jones of the austin chronicle said that the film's "glancing relationship with reality" involving its main heroine, story and setting doesn't translate well on the silver screen and is more suited as a made-for-tv movie, concluding with, "if the filmmakers can't be bothered to believe in the real-world implications of its premise, then why ever should we?" mark feeney of the boston globe gave credit to the supporting performances of leonardo nam and debbie reynolds for having "an out-of-left-field quality the rest of the movie lacks."despite heigl and the film's supporting cast being up to the task, frank scheck of the hollywood reporter felt they were undone by a script unsure of its genre, saying that it "mostly resembles a failed television pilot, a feeling which is only reinforced by its late-january release and failure to be screened for critics." jeff otto from indiewire repeated what scheck wrote about the genre confusion, saying that it carries elements of a romantic comedy but "otherwise [the film] dabbles in thriller territory, sort of an attempt at elmore leonard gone jersey shore. but its not smart enough for that." feeney felt the film was having a genre battle with itself over "gritty-ethnic inner city vs. girly-girly comic", calling it "chick-lit [elmore] leonard." entertainment weekly's owen gleiberman added that if said "[elmore] leonard movie was scripted by a bad nora ephron imitator."many critics derided heigl for her portrayal of stephanie plum. sam adams of the a.v. club found her miscast as stephanie because she lacked any spunk or tenacity to make the character tolerable and charming, despite some decent comedic timing, saying "there's a hollowness at the movies center, right where heigl's heart should be." andrew barker from variety wrote about heigl having "an almost standoffish lack of conviction" in her performance, and elizabeth weitzman of the new york daily news described her as being "too movie-star glam, [too] stiffly prissy, and [too] lacking in any affection for stephanie herself." gleiberman saw heigl as being unsuitable to emulate the mannerisms of a guidette, saying that she portrays "working-class sexy slovenliness in an overly thought-out way." rolling stone's peter travers also noted heigl's miscasting as part of a "cringingly false" film that's devoid of the "evanovich talent and energy" throughout the direction and screenwriting, concluding that one for the money is "so godawful there'll never be another plum movie to rectify this mess. evanovich deserved better."despite the poor reception, author janet evanovich was delighted with how the film turned out and did some joint interviews with heigl to promote the film. evanovich stated that she would now envision heigl as stephanie when writing the character. complex placed the film at number five on its list of the 25 worst movies of 2012. complex staff writer matt barone said, "[i]f the movie's only offense was how it soils the garden state's reputation worse than jwoww, it'd be reprehensible, but not worthy of severe public humiliation. but considering that one for the money is also about as funny as a colonic, there's nothing left to do but rip it apart before banishing the flick from our memory banks."
