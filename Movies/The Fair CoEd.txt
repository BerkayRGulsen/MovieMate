== production ==
in her 25th film, marion davies starred as a madcap college student with a yen for the basketball coach johnny mack brown. william randolph hearst always disliked this film and disliked director sam wood. hearst always referred to this film as "that cheap-looking comedy" that went for "yap laughs." but laughs there were as davies joins the college basketball team to be near brown and to spite her rival (jane winton). davies races back and forth on basketball courts, zooms about in jalopies, and even climbs a tree in this one. one of the highlights in the shooting of this film was when charles lindbergh visited the set. davies was his favorite movie star. this was another box-office hit for davies.
