== club career ==


=== bayer leverkusen and san jose earthquakes ===

later in 1999, donovan signed a six-year contract for german bundesliga club bayer leverkusen, whose sporting director michael reschke spotted him at a youth tournament in europe. despite becoming a regular starter for the club's reserve team upon arrival, donovan had trouble adapting to life overseas and was allowed extended training periods with united states youth national teams. he played in a german cup match for the reserve team. unhappy with his situation with leverkusen, donovan was loaned to the san jose earthquakes of major league soccer (mls) for the 2001 season. in mls, donovan had immediate success, leading the earthquakes to mls cup championships in 2001 and 2003 and becoming one of the only recognizable faces of soccer in america. in four years in the league, he scored 32 goals and 29 assists in league play, and ten goals and six assists in the playoffs. two of those goals were in the 2003 mls cup, a 42 earthquakes triumph over chicago fire sc. donovan earned man of the match for his actions. he was named u.s. soccer athlete of the year in 2003.in 2004, donovan became the first man to be named the u.s. soccer athlete of the year three years in a row before returning to the bayer leverkusen first team in january 2005. after playing seven matches with leverkusen in the 200405 season, only two of which were starts, donovan requested to leave the club. despite a late offer from english premier league club portsmouth, donovan expressed a desire to return to the united states. upon his re-entry to mls, san jose was denied the chance to re-sign donovan because earthquakes general manager alexi lalas had traded away his rights. la galaxy, his hometown team, were able to trade leading scorer carlos ruiz to fc dallas to get on top of the mls allocation order as donovan prepared to leave germany.


=== la galaxy ===


==== 20052014 ====
donovan signed a multi-year contract with la galaxy, making him the highest-paid american player in the league. in his first season at the club, donovan scored 12 league goals with 10 assists and added four goals and an assist in the playoffs as la galaxy won the mls cup (his third mls championship to date). he was named to the mls all-time best xi after the season. in his second season with la galaxy, donovan scored 12 league goals and 8 assists. he also scored three goals in the open cup. despite this, donovan and la galaxy failed to make the playoffs and lost in the open cup to  chicago fire sc. donovan's playoff goals make him mls' second all-time leading scorer in the playoffs with 14, behind carlos ruiz's 15.

donovan had a mixed year with la galaxy in 2007. upon the signing and arrival of david beckham, donovan relinquished his captaincy to the english superstar. in the 2007 superliga tournament, donovan was the top scorer. he scored a goal in every match except for the final. he scored six goals in five matches. at this point in his career, donovan had 84 all-time regular season goals putting him in seventh place on the league's all-time scoring list. although the 2008 season was a disappointment for la galaxy, it was a banner year for donovan as he scored 20 goals and 9 assists in 25 matches, forming a strong offensive partnership with david beckham and edson buddle.after his former national team manager bruce arena was named la galaxy head coach and beckham joined milan on loan in early 2009, donovan once again was given the club captaincy on a permanent basis. in july 2009, donovan received praise and criticism for his critical comments about beckham in sports illustrated journalist grant wahl's book the beckham experiment, calling beckham a poor captain and teammate. he later apologized to beckham for discussing his concerns to a reporter rather than to him directly. the two reconciled upon beckham's mid-season return to los angeles and donovan enjoyed an outstanding 2009 campaign, winning the league's most valuable player and mls goal of the year 2009 award and leading la galaxy to mls cup 2009, which they lost on penalties. following the season, donovan agreed to a four-year extension to his contract with la galaxy, with clauses that allow him to seek loans during the mls offseason. on august 1, 2010, donovan scored the 100th goal of his mls career. on september 18, 2010, he became the all-time leading scorer for la galaxy.la galaxy had another successful campaign in 2010 winning the supporters' shield for the first time since 2003. in that campaign, donovan scored 7 goals and a team-high 16 assists.  in the playoffs, la galaxy would ultimately succumb to fc dallas in the semifinals.
in 2011, la galaxy again won the mls supporter's shield. in the 2011 mls cup, donovan scored the title-clinching goal in the 72nd minute over the houston dynamo, securing his fourth mls cup title.
donovan was named the mls cup mvp.
in october 2012, donovan expressed his desire to take a break from his professional soccer career, citing physical and mental exhaustion as the main reasons. in la galaxy's next match, the 2012 mls cup, a rematch with houston, donovan converted a penalty kick in the 65th minute of play to give la a 21 lead. the goal was donovan's fifth in mls cup finals. la galaxy went on to win their second straight mls cup, 31.
donovan returned to training with la galaxy on march 25, 2013, and made his season debut five days later against toronto fc, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute. however, upon his return, it was announced he would be forced to relinquish the captaincy to robbie keane for the 2013 season. he scored two goals against chivas usa, tying him with jeff cunningham together as the top mls goalscorer with 134 goals. on may 25, 2014, donovan scored twice against the philadelphia union to break cunningham's record of 134, making donovan mls's all-time leading goalscorer with 136 goals. on august 6, 2014, he scored the winning goal at the 2014 mls all-star game, putting the ball past bayern munich goalkeeper manuel neuer at the 70th minute, he was subsequently substituted for sporting kansas city striker dom dwyer and gave the captain's armband to canadian international will johnson. on august 7, 2014, donovan announced he would be retiring at the end of the 2014 major league soccer season; the season ended with la galaxy winning their fourth mls cup of the donovan era on december 7, 2014.


==== loans to other clubs ====

in november 2008, donovan trained with bayern munich, before joining the german club on loan until the start of the 2009 mls season in mid-march. during his stay with bayern, donovan had appearances in five friendly matches, in which he scored four goals, six league matches and one dfb-pokal match. at the end of the loan period, bayern declined to extend his loan.after the 2009 mls season had finished, donovan joined english premier league side everton on loan in january 2010, though there was strong suggestions he could join his american teammates at fulham. during this period, he played in 13 matches in all competitions, scored two goals and was named the club's player of the month for january. everton were keen on extending his loan deal, but la galaxy refused, and donovan returned to the u.s. in time for the start of the 2010 mls season.an agreement was reached in december 2011 for donovan to spend another two months at everton beginning in january 2012. he made his returning debut on january 4, 2012, against bolton wanderers, a 21 defeat. in his third match on loan, he assisted everton's only goal in a 11 draw against aston villa on january 14. on january 27, he assisted in both goals in a 21 win over fulham in the fa cup fourth round proper. on january 31, he assisted in darron gibson's winning goal over manchester city. donovan took his tally of assists to seven when he assisted denis stracqualursi's goal in a 20 victory over chelsea on february 11.


=== return to la galaxy ===
on september 8, 2016, donovan announced his return from retirement and officially signed with la galaxy for the remainder of the 2016 season (six regular season games and any consecutive play-off matches).donovan explained that the injuries sustained by the club late in the season led to his decision to return:

two weeks ago, i was working as an analyst on the la galaxy vs. vancouver whitecaps match and during that game, la galaxy suffered injuries to three players: jelle van damme, steven gerrard and gyasi zardes. over the next few days, nigel de jong was transferred to galatasaray and news broke that gyasi would be out for the rest of the season.
since my retirement, i have remained in close contact with many of the staff and players on la galaxy. i spoke with some of them that week and they jokingly asked if i was ready to make a return to the field to help fill some of the void left by the injuries and departures.

i reminded them that i haven't played a meaningful soccer game in almost two years and i certainly couldn't fill the holes left by those players. over the ensuing days, i began to think about their inquiries and it struck me that perhaps this is something i should consider. i care so deeply about the galaxy organization, and i believe i could help in a small way to aid the team in its quest for a sixth mls championship.
on september 11, 2016, donovan entered the match against orlando city as a substitute on the 83rd minute. as his traditional number 10 was worn by giovani dos santos, donovan selected number 26, which he wore at bayer leverkusen when he began his career in 1999.donovan scored a goal in his second match after returning to la galaxy. on september 18, 2016, he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute in a match against sporting kansas city and scored two minutes later to tie the game 22.altogether, donovan played in all six remaining matches of the 2016 regular season, as well as in all three play-off matches. he started in five of them and scored one goal. at the end of the play-off run, donovan retired for the second time.

after missing the first two world cup qualifiers of 2013 due to his extended off-season sabbatical, donovan was left off of the squad by jrgen klinsmann for the june qualifying matches, despite having returned to playing full-time in march. however, donovan was re-called to the national team for the 2013 concacaf gold cup to be played in july. on july 5, 2013, he became the first u.s. player to reach the 50 international goal mark and the fourth man in concacaf to score 50 international goals after a brace against guatemala in a warmup friendly before the gold cup. four days later, donovan became the first player to reach 50 goals and 50 assists for the united states during a 61 group stage victory in their 2013 gold cup opener against belize in which he had one goal and two assists. after the u.s. won the gold cup title with a 10 victory over panama, donovan was awarded the tournament's best player trophy after tying for the tournament lead with five goals scored. he started every match of the tournament for the united states. donovan was recalled to the full national squad for the first time in over a year for the u.s.'s september world cup qualifying matches against costa rica and mexico. donovan started and played 90 minutes in both games. with the u.s. needing a win over mexico to clinch qualification, donovan's corner kick assisted eddie johnson's go-ahead goal in the 57th minute. then, in the 78th minute, donovan scored off a low cross from mix diskerud to make the score 20, and effectively seal the win, and the world cup berth.in may 2014, donovan was named in the preliminary squad for the 2014 world cup and joined the team in training camp. however, on may 22, 2014, he was controversially omitted from the final u.s. squad by manager jrgen klinsmann. donovan's absence from the team even became the comedic subject of a playstation commercial where donovan makes light of his newly found free time. klinsmann later called his decision "one of the toughest decisions in [his] coaching career", but said, "i just think the other guys right now are a little bit ahead of him." klinsmann's decision, which was described by media staff as abruptly timed after klinsmann had previously promised to wait until after the team's friendly matches to announce cuts, saw additional controversy when klinsmann's son jonathan published and later deleted a post on twitter that appeared to ridicule donovan following the announcement.on october 10, 2014, donovan played his 157th and final match for the united states in a friendly against ecuador in east hartford, connecticut. the match was arranged by united states soccer federation president sunil gulati to give donovan a proper farewell, despite the disagreement between donovan and klinsmann. following his retirement, he was named by the guardian as the u.s. team's greatest ever player.after playing in the major arena soccer league during the 201819 season, donovan was named to the united states national arena soccer team ahead of a friendly against mexico.
