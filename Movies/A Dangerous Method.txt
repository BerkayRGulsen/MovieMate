== plot ==
in august 1904, sabina spielrein arrives at the burghlzli, the pre-eminent psychiatric hospital in zrich, suffering from hysteria and begins a new course of treatment with the young swiss doctor carl jung. he uses word association and dream interpretation as part of his approach to psychoanalysis, and finds that spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child when her father spanked her naked.
jung and chief of medicine eugen bleuler recognize spielrein's intelligence and energy, and allow her to assist them in their experiments. she measures the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide empirical data as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis. she soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients. the doctors, jung and freud, correspond at length before they meet, and begin sharing their dreams and analysing each other, and freud himself soon adopts jung as his heir and agent.
jung finds in spielrein a kindred spirit, and their attraction deepens due to transference. jung resists the idea of cheating on his wife, emma, and breaking the taboo of sex with a patient, but his resolve is weakened by the wild and unrepentant confidences of his new patient otto gross, a brilliant, philandering, unstable psychoanalyst. gross decries monogamy in general and suggests that resistance to transference is symptomatic of the repression of normal, healthy sexual impulses, exhorting jung to indulge himself with abandon.
jung finally begins an affair with spielrein, including rudimentary bondage and spanking. things become even more tangled as he becomes her advisor to her dissertation; he publishes not only his studies of her as a patient but eventually her treatise as well. spielrein wants to conceive a child with jung, but he refuses. after his attempt to confine their relationship again to doctor and patient, she appeals to freud for his professional help, and forces jung to tell freud the truth about their relationship, reminding him that she could have publicly damaged him but did not want to.
jung and freud journey to america. however, cracks appear in their friendship as they begin to disagree more frequently on matters of psychoanalysis. jung and spielrein meet to work on her dissertation in switzerland, and begin their sexual relationship once more. however, after jung refuses to leave his wife for her, spielrein decides to go to vienna. she meets freud, and says that although she sides with him, she believes he and jung need to reconcile for psychoanalysis to continue to develop.
following freud's collapse at an academic conference, he and jung continue correspondence via letters. they decide to end their relationship after increasing hostilities and accusations regarding the differences in their conceptualisation of psychoanalysis. spielrein marries a russian doctor and, while pregnant, visits jung and his wife. they discuss psychoanalysis and jung's new mistress. jung confides that his love for spielrein made him a better person.
the film's footnote reveals the eventual fates of the four analysts. gross starved to death in berlin in 1920. freud died of cancer in london in 1939 after being driven out of vienna by the nazis. spielrein trained a number of analysts in the soviet union, before she and her two daughters were shot by the nazis in 1942. jung emerged from a nervous breakdown to become the world's leading psychologist before dying in 1961.

== reception ==
on the review aggregator rotten tomatoes, the film holds a 78% approval rating, based on 187 reviews with an average rating of 6.85/10. the website's critics consensus reads: "a provocative historical fiction about the early days of psychoanalysis, a dangerous method is buoyed by terrific performances by michael fassbender, keira knightley, and viggo mortensen."louise keller reports from urban cinephile, "the best scenes are those between mortensen and fassbender...the tension between the two men mounts as their views conflict: freud insists that sex is an underlying factor in every neurosis while jung, interested in spiritualism and the occult, is disappointed by what he considers to be freud's 'rigid pragmatism.'"andrew o'hehir's review on salon notes that on the one hand freud's "single-minded focus on sexual repression as the source of neurosis led to the creation of psychiatry as a legitimate medical and scientific fieldone that was often resistant to change and dominated by authoritarian father figures." on the other hand, sabina's effect on jung, and "the discoveries they had made together, both in the office and the bedroom," including the potential in "a creative fusion of oppositesdoctor and patient, man and woman, dark and light, jew and aryan," led to a falling out between the two men "over a variety of issues, most notably the scientific limits of psychiatric inquiry."in contrast, steven rea of the philadelphia inquirer wrote that, despite the film's exploration of "the way our subconscious works, the way we repress, and suppress, natural urgesthe constant battle between the rational and the instinctive, the civilized and the wild", the film "feels distant, and clinical, in ways you wished it did not." in an interview with the daily beast's marlow stern, cronenberg himself is quoted as saying that the love scenes between jung and spelrein were "quite clinical. these were people who, even when they were having sex, they were observing themselves having sex because they were so interested in their reactions to things."the film was listed at number 5 on film comment magazine's best films of 2011 list.
