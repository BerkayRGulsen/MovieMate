== reception ==


=== critical ===
the los angeles times said cummings plays "a likable cad who isn't too likable outside of his own natural effervescence." the new york times said it was made with "a lack of success... only robert cummings, as the bouncing hero, gives the impression of enjoying himself. and mr cummings's enthusiasm is of the bouncing, juvenile sort. so the whole thing adds up to a vapid and completely inconsequential charade."in 1945 george sidney told a reporter doing a profile on him that "i'm sure you missed [the film] and you were lucky if you did." one of sidney's obituaries called it "a feeble comedy." however it did launch his career.


== box office ==
according to mgm records the film earned $205,000 in the us and canada and $128,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $33,000.
