== critical reception ==
the new york times wrote, "an obvious fly-by-night, with a pretty good cast headed by the gifted margaret leighton and john justin, this associated artists release is a slow, contrived and exasperatingly arch puzzler that sets some sort of record for meandering banality". the radio times called the film a "passable thriller" with "more than a hint of the third man."
