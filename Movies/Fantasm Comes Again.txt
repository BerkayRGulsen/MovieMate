== production ==
the linking scenes between the two journalists were shot in australia, and the sex scenes were filmed over 12 days in los angeles by an australian director and cinematographer, using american porn stars.the budget was larger on the sequel in an attempt to attract a bigger audience; in contrast with the original, where only one of the ten stories was lip sync and the rest in voice over, all the stories in fantasm comes again had lip sync dialogue. ginnane later thought this was a mistake as it distracted from what was on screen.


== reception ==
the film sold well around the world but was not as popular as fantasm at the australian box office. ginnane blamed the fact by the time it was released there was a glut of sex films on the market and the delay caused by censorship hold ups. (in 1980 david stratton called it "the most censored of the new australian films.") by 1979 the film had not yet broken even but ginnane was confident that would be the case.ginnane later said that he felt colin eggleston was just as competent a director as richard franklin but thought his sense of humour was different "and perhaps it didn't suit the material as well".
