== reception ==
rotten tomatoes, review aggregator, reports that 37% of 19 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5/10.  glenn lovell of variety called it "a cloying, mechanically plotted comedy".  lawrence van gelder of the new york times wrote, "[t]he graceful literary and directorial touch of morgan j. freeman turns these youngsters into individuals rather than cinema's customary caricatures".  john anderson of the los angeles times wrote, "it's a small story, perhaps even an ephemeral movie, but desert blue also has a novelistic capacity for character and setting, without either the maudlin sentimentality or gratuitous vulgarity of most teen-oriented movies."  roger ebert of the chicago sun-times rated it three out of four stars and compared it to the last picture show and u turn, saying that it is the "herbal tea" version of the latter.  lisa schwarzbaum  of entertainment weekly rated it c and described the setting as "yet another indie drama set in a burg reminiscent, by way of aggressive eccentricity, of tv's northern exposure."
