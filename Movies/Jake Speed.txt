== plot ==
in paris, a girl named maureen winston (becca c. ashley) is abducted by two evil-looking men. while her family prays for her safe return, maureen's father heaps guilt on her sister margaret (karen kopins), since she convinced her to go see the world. however, margaret's grandfather (leon ames) has an idea: call for jake speed (wayne crawford) to go and rescue her. one problem exists: jake speed is a character in a series of 1940s-style pulp fiction novels.
however, jake speed does exist, as margaret finds out, when he leaves a note for her to meet him and his sidekick, desmond floyd (dennis christopher), in a tough paris bar. the novels, as margaret finds out, are based on jake and des's real-life adventures, and they work for nothing, seeing action and excitement (and another novel) as their reward.
jake reveals that maureen was kidnapped by white slavers, and is being held in an african country. jake, des, and margaret fly to the nation, which is in the middle of a civil war, to rescue her. many twists and turns later, jake's archenemy, the evil, perverted, murderous englishman sid (john hurt), is revealed to be behind the ring, and soon, margaret becomes a part of it. jake and des must now rescue both maureen and margaret, stop sid, and help the girls get out in one piece, while dealing with warring factions, pits of lions, and machine gun-firing helicopters.
