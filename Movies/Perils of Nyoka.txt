=== main cast ===
kay aldridge as nyoka gordon. aldridge replaced frances gifford as nyoka. the success and popularity she gained from her role in this serial made kay aldridge the star of several of the better republic serials for years after its release. in his autobiography, director william witney stated that the studio decided to use a different actress just to further ensure that there would be no actionable copyright infringement. ray stedman, however, writes that gifford was not cast in this serial because she had been on loan from another studio for jungle girl and was not available for the filming of this serial.  cline partially backs this point of view, saying that gifford was unavailable to reprise her role because she had moved on to feature films.

== production ==
perils of nyoka was budgeted at $169,296 although the final negative cost was $175,010 (a $5,714, or 3.4%, overspend).  it was the most expensive republic serial of 1942. it was filmed between march 20 and may 2, 1942, with the outdoor action sequences shot primarily at the iverson movie ranch in chatsworth, calif. the serial's production number was 1197.the success of the original serial jungle girl prompted the sequel, but the studio did not want to pay licensing fees to burroughs again, so it avoided any repetition of the term "jungle girl," to which he had the rights. instead, "nyoka," the name of the main character in the first film, was placed in the title of the sequel, because that name was an original creation of republic's writers, not of burroughs. the very word "jungle" was avoided in the movie, with the setting described as an african "desert", though the area shown was not nearly as arid as the sahara.
