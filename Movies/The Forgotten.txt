== plot ==
telly paretta (julianne moore) grieves the loss of her son, sam (christopher kovaleski), who died 14 months prior in a plane crash. she holds regular vigils in his undisturbed bedroom, visits his grave, and meets with a support group for parents who lost their children to accidents, though her husband, jim (anthony edwards), wants to move on.  returning from work one afternoon, telly finds sam's room completely empty of his things and redecorated with new furniture. furious, she confronts jim for trying to forget, but her husband jim shocks her with a counter accusation: that she is, in actuality, delusional and that they have never had a son. 
hurt, telly begins reaching out to friends and acquaintances to confirm sam's existence; however, her friend eliot (jessica hecht) doesn't appear to believe in sam's existence despite her closeness to him. looking for concrete evidence, she visits dr. munce (gary sinise), her ob/gyn; he confirms that she was pregnant, but that she miscarried and "sam" is her delusional fantasy about how her life would have been different if he had lived. he recommends that she be sent to a hospital, but she runs away. 
fleeing and still adamant that sam is real, she locates ash (dominic west), a member of the support group, whose daughter lauren (kathryn faughnan), was sam's friend and died in the same crash. however, he also dismisses her and claims he never had a daughter, and calls the police. shaken by telly's certainty, he explores his house, discovering lauren's old room covered up by new paint and wallpaper; in a rush, he remembers his daughter and losing her. chasing after telly, he rescues her from the police and they go into hiding, pursued by national security agents. on the run, they speculate about who would have the power, resources, and motive to want to make them forget about their children.
telly and ash capture and threaten a pursuing agent (lee tergesen), who reluctantly reveals that he and other agents are merely helping them in order to protect humankind. without warning, the roof of the house blows off and the agent, along with the roof, is sucked into the skypresumably taken by "them"and telly and ash flee. eventually, telly visits dr. munce again and he reveals that the disappearances are the work of "them", and that the government monitors their trials, all too aware that they have no power to stop "them" from doing whatever they want.
munce takes telly to an airport and the dilapidated hangar of quest airlines, where he introduces her to an agent of "them" (linus roache). he tells the agent that it's over and to stop the experiment, because it will only cause more harm. but the agent replies that it's not over. he reveals to telly that she has been a part of an experiment to test whether the bonds between mother and child can be diminished. in her case, her memories could not be fully erased. telly refuses to deny her son's existence. the agent mentions that if he fails to erase her memory then he will look like a failure. the agent then subdues her and convinces her to think of the first memory she had of sam. telly thinks of the day he was born in the hospital, which allows the agent to successfully erase sam's memory from existence. as the agent is walking away, thinking he's succeeded, telly's motherly bond kicks in deeper, to before sam was born, when she was pregnant, triggering her memory that she indeed had life in her at one time. all of her memories of sam return. before the agent can comprehend what's happening, part of the hangar roof is suddenly blown off, and he's yanked into the sky himself for his failure to erase her memory. this ends the experiment.
telly finds herself living a normal life, although she remembers everything that has happened. she reunites with sam at a park. also at the park is ash, watching over his daughter.  like sam, he has no memory of what has happened. telly reintroduces herself, and the two sit and watch the kids play in the playground.
