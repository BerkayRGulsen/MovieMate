marilyn was selected by film historians steve chibnall and brian mcfarlane as one of the 15 most meritorious british b films made between world war ii and 1970. the authors note that it is "symptomatic of a transatlantic turn in the british 'b'" and praise its depiction of a "pervasive sense of dissatisfaction with things as they are".
