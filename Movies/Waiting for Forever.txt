waiting for forever went into limited theatrical release on february 4, 2011, and played from three to 14 theaters during its two-week run. with a production budget of us$5 million, it grossed $25,517.the film was panned by critics. as of june 2020, the film holds a 5% approval rating on review aggregate site rotten tomatoes, based on 19 reviews with an average rating for 2.31/10. stephen holden of the new york times wrote, "more often than not, i felt suffocated by the gaseous sentimentality and lightheadedness of a story that drops in subplots that it can't begin to develop." david noh of film journal international found the will character to be "nothing more than a stalker, and it is the premise of james keach's idiotic simper of a film that you find his behavior not only somehow justifiable, but irresistible. ... keach tries to amp things up in the last act by throwing in a supposed murder that is merely groan-inducing, especially when you realize that this will only extend the already excruciating exposition." while acceding noh's former point, pete hammond of boxoffice nonetheless called it a "refreshingly pure, honest and original love story", and bemoaned that, "a small movie that sports no real exploitative elements except genuine human interactions is a tough sell."
