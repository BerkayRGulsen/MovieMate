fat pizza vs. housos is an australian film based on the combination of the stories and characters of the sbs series pizza and the comedy series housos, both created by paul fenech. the film began screening in australian cinemas on 27 november 2014.


== plot ==
after serving 15 years in jail for assaulting a health inspector with a chainsaw, pizza chef bobo gigliotti is released. upon his release, he and his mama attempt to reopen fat pizza, their former business in the fictional sydney suburb of hashfield. they soon find that due to rent increases since the time they were last in business, the only place that they can afford to reopen their pizzeria is in the infamous housing commission suburb of sunnyvale. employing many of their previous workers including sleek the elite, as well as a few locals, their re-establishment in sunnyvale results in conflict with the local housos, notably shazza jones, franky falzoni and kev the kiwi.the movie briefly includes references to fenech's two other television series, with franky falzoni stealing a van belonging to swift and shift couriers early in the film and a segment from bogan hunters being shown on tv in a scene where franky is watching television.
the film features a "thongarang", which is a boomerang made of two bolted-together thongs.


== production ==
the film was written and produced in only 10 months on a modest budget of around $1 million. filming occurred in western sydney, melbourne and canberra. the film is dedicated to alfred "freddie" fenech oam.


=== casting ===
the movie features almost the entire all-star cast of the tv series "fat pizza" and "housos". notable among those missing is rebel wilson who played toula in "fat pizza". producer paul fenech noted that her high profile status in hollywood made it difficult for her to find time to return to australia for filming.


== reception ==
fat pizza vs housos debuted at 8th place in australian movie ticket sales, earning $280,604 in 52 theatres during its opening weekend. it was the only australian-made film to feature in the weekend's top 10.
long after 1000 sensitive, lyrical mood pieces have been forgotten, there'll surely be a place in australian film history for the unsinkable paul fenech  writer-director-star of fat pizza, housos vs authority, and now fat pizza vs housos, in which the characters from two of his knockabout tv comedies go head to head on the big screen.
