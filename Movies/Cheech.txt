cheech & chong are a comedy duo consisting of cheech marin and tommy chong. the duo found commercial and cultural success in the 1970s and 1980s with their stand-up routines, studio recordings, and feature films, which were based on the hippie and free love era, and especially drug and counterculture movements, most notably their love for cannabis.


== career ==
the duo met in vancouver, british columbia, in the late 1960s. chong was a canadian citizen, and cheech had moved there from southern california to avoid the draft at the height of the vietnam war. the pair performed stand-up shows, released many successful comedy record albums, and starred in a series of low-budget films. some of their best-known comedy routines and songs include "earache my eye", "basketball jones", "santa claus and his old lady", and "sister mary elephant". perhaps their most famous line is "dave's not here", from their self-titled debut album.
their early success culminated with the release of their first feature-length movie, up in smoke, in 1978. it became something of a cult classic, and was also successful enough at the box office (grossing over $44 million despite a low budget) to warrant two sequels: cheech and chong's next movie in 1980, and  nice dreams in 1981. these were followed by the less successful things are tough all over (1982) and still smokin (1983). the pair attempted a departure from their stoner comedy with 1984's cheech & chong's the corsican brothers. to date, their most recent starring vehicle as a duo was 2014's cheech & chong's animated movie. 
tommy chong directed four of their films while co-writing and starring in all seven with cheech marin.
they also appeared in smaller supporting roles in graham chapman's yellowbeard and martin scorsese's after hours.
in 1985 the duo released their album get out of my room, which included the novelty hit song "born in east l.a." (based on bruce springsteen's "born in the u.s.a.").  this song later served as the basis for 1987 film of the same title, in which cheech marin played the starring role. immediately following the release of the album, cheech marin separated himself from the pair's drug-inspired act by working on a solo career. 
on june 25, 2019, the new york times magazine listed cheech & chong among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 universal fire.


=== reunion ===
after their contentious parting in the 1980s, the duo spent years without working together. in 1992 the two worked together for the first time in several years, voicing characters in the animated film ferngully: the last rainforest. in 1997, chong made an appearance on marin's tv series nash bridges, in an episode titled "wild card", which contained a reference to their iconic "dave" skit from their 1972 debut album. in 2000 both performers voiced characters in the animated television series south park for the episode "cherokee hair tampons", but their voices were recorded separately. both marin and chong indicated in a 2003 episode of biography that they were willing to reunite.
the duo had plans to reunite for another film when chong's california-based company, chong's glass, was raided by federal officials in february 2003, as part of a federal crackdown on "drug-related paraphernalia".  in a plea bargain which allowed his son and wife to remain out of jail, chong pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to distribute drug paraphernalia in may, and in september 2003 was sentenced to nine months in federal prison, fined $20,000, and forced to forfeit $120,000 in assets. he was released in july 2004. his cellmate was jordan belfort.with chong released, the duo planned to resume production on a reunion film. a variety of titles were rumored, including grumpy old stoners. but they announced in september 2005 that the reunion film had been canceled.  beginning in september 2008, cheech and chong reunited for the light up america comedy tour which opened in ottawa, making a radio program appearance on the bob & tom show. in march 2009, they recorded two shows at the majestic theatre in san antonio for a dvd release of the reunion tour.

in 1980, there were plans to make a film called riding high with cheech & chong.ivan reitman conceived stripes as a cheech and chong vehicle. cheech and chong's manager thought the script was very funny; however, the comedy duo wanted complete creative control, so reitman told the screenwriters to rewrite it for bill murray and harold ramis.screenwriter tom mcloughlin also pitched a sequel to the slasher film friday the 13th in which cheech and chong, playing camp counselors, faced off against killer jason voorhees, as a comedy horror movie in the vein of abbott and costello meet frankenstein.the hyenas banzai and shenzi in the 1994 animated film the lion king were storyboarded as being characters modeled after cheech and chong. due to the duo not getting along with each other at the time, and whoopi goldberg taking interest in the role of shenzi, chong was not cast, but cheech played the part of banzai.
