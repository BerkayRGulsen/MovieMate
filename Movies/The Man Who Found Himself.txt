the man who found himself, also known as wings of mercy, is a 1937 american aviation film based on the unpublished story "wings of mercy" by alice f. curtis. the film marked the first starring role for 19-year-old joan fontaine, who was billed as the "new rko screen personality", highlighted following the end of the film by a special "on screen" introduction. unlike many of the period films that appeared to glorify aviation, it is a complex film, examining the motivations of both doctors and pilots.
