jack's agency client, meanwhile, wants him to get actor al pacino to appear in a dunkin' donuts commercial to promote a new coffee called the "dunkaccino." jack takes jill to a lakers game with pacino in attendance. pacino ignores jack but is infatuated with jill, as he and jill grew up on the same street, and gives her his phone number. pacino brings jill to his home, though she is uninterested in him and soon leaves. jack's mexican gardener felipe, also smitten with jill, takes her to meet his family at their annual fiesta, where she hits it off with everybody.
pacino refuses to do the commercial unless jack gets him another date with jill, forcing jack to invite jill on a cruise he initially planned only for the family. however, she still refuses to see pacino again, so jack disguises himself as his sister and goes on a date with the actor. jill (hearing pacino's voice in the background of a phone call with her brother) learns she was invited just so pacino would do the commercial, and goes back home to the bronx out of dejection. feeling guilty, jack, as well as erin and the kids, follow her. 
on new year's eve, jill encounters a group of former classmates and bullies, led by monica, at a restaurant. jack, erin and their kids show up, the twin siblings reconciling by conversing in their made-up twin language. when monica attacks erin, she is cold cocked by jill. pacino arrives and tells jill that while he has feelings for her, there is another man more worthy of her than himself. she goes home to find felipe and his children, where they begin a relationship. the television commercial is made, with pacino starring and singing a rap song, and he disapproves of it.

== analysis ==
jack and jill is another gender bendering comedy film released in the 21st century starring crossdressing male actors, including all the queen's men (2001), sorority boys (2002), and white chicks (2004); as with other gender bender films, it questions gender identity while at the same time reinforcing social norms through its humor. the film is similar to sandler's other work for its negative portrayal of women; most of the jokes revolve around jill's appearance not fitting a hollywood beauty standard, and jack's wife never has her own desires come into play.similar to other movies where one actor is cast as multiple identities, it depicts a doppelgnger presenting character flaws to the original identity; jack is a resentful man working for a vapid media industry, and his time with jill teaches him that he needs those who love him, no matter what attributes they have.according to critic a. o. scott, films like jack and jill and grown ups (2010) present a comedy style representative of sander's "grumpy, dumpy middle age" phase. whereas his 1990s films had an aggressive immaturity with themes of anti-authoritarianism and rebuffs of decorum, his early 2010s output depicts sandler playing a wealthy protagonist and mocks those with perceived-to-be-odd physical appearances and ethnicities. jack, who has a higher-status job with a house and a family, is the straight man while the target of the humor is her bronx-residing sister's rude attitude, nasally high-pitched voice, neediness, and low intellect (i.e. her lack of knowledge of the internet).
