behindwoods wrote "the plot seems to be out of the world for an indian movie, but jananadhan manages his best to do justice to the movie. power packed with some amazing performances by jeeva, pasupathy, ashish vidhyarthi, and nayantara, e is definitely worth the money that is spent on the tickets". sify wrote "on the downside the film lacks entertainment and the second half drags".
