== plot summary ==
deepa (vidya sinha) is a graduate student in delhi who is in a long-term relationship with sanjay (amol palekar), whom she plans to marry. sanjay is a loquacious, humorous, and a good individual who is also rather lackadaisical and forgetful with no sense of punctuality.
a job interview call from a college in mumbai re-acquaints her with navin (dinesh thakur) whom she had split up with under acrimonious circumstances. navin is in every way the antithesis of sanjay: he is very punctual and looks after her during her stay in mumbai. navin shows her the city and helps her with the job interview. this rekindles deepa's feelings for him, and she finds herself torn between the two men and between her past and her present. upon her return to delhi, she feels that her first love (navin) is her true love. she receives a letter stating that she has got the job in mumbai. at the same time sanjay comes to her house and tells her that he has got a promotion. deepa then feels that she should forget the past and marry sanjay.

=== casting ===
director basu chatterjee's original cast was shashi kapoor, sharmila tagore and amitabh bachchan. then he switched to bengali actors, aparna sen and samit bhanja. even classical dancer mallika sarabhai was to be cast as lead, but her final mba exams clashed and eventually debutante vidya sinha got the role after she responded to one of the ads placed by basu chatterjee.this was the first hindi film of amol palekar, who at that time was a less known  theater actor. in an interview in 2015 with s.m. irfan on rajya sabha tv, palekar described the circumstances in which he made this switch to mainstream acting. during one of their meetings at the "film forum" (one of the leading film societies of bombay at that time) basu chatterjee showed palekar the story "yahi sach hai" by mannu bhandari to read. once palekar finished reading it, chatterjee showed him the script that had been written based on this story. he thereafter asked him if he would like to play the leading role in it. palekar, a trained artist from the jj school of art and a theater actor had at that time worked in two marathi films including shaantata court chaalu aahe, by satyadev dubey and govind nihalani.
