== reception ==
this film got some average reviews. madhureeta mukherjee from times of india gave it 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, "the film often rolls out like a play or a social commentary with staged events (often over-stretched) that result in an abrupt narrative. the stark portrayal of bare-faced reality (devoid of background music) with a cast of commoners - gives it a docu-drama flavour. 'dtd' is 'grave' alright, but offers hilarity in decent doses." subhash k. jha of ians gave it 4 out of 5, "by using the twin missiles of satire and irony, he brings into a play a kind of pinned-down provocativeness into the plot whereby the characters become real and representational simultaneously." and added,"to record the dirt on the wall and the blood on the floor with such clarity and honesty is not within the creative powers of every filmmaker." shubhra gupta of indian express, who gave 3 out of 5 stars, explained, "khans film gets into theatrical territory every once in a while, but there is no denying its terrifying power. he pulls no punches, and paints extremism from both sides equally black." and suggested, "this is an important film, and i do hope it gets seen widely, timely and topical as it is in the time of muzzafarnagar, misguided mullahs and modified bhakts."
