== reception ==
the film did not really take off at the box office. and to add to its woes the reviews were not too good either. however actor riteish deshmukh seems to have pleased everyone with his performance as he got some great reviews. noyon jyoti parasara of aol india said, "truly this movie is ritesh's. ritesh has already established himself as a good comic actor and de taali seconds that."
