== plot ==
in 1947, when aung san suu kyi was two years old, her father aung san led burma to independence. but soon afterwards, on 19 july 1947, he, along with a group of his colleagues, was assassinated by a group of armed men in uniform.as an adult suu kyi went to england, found a loving husband, and had a happy family life. but in 1988 her mother's poor health forced her to return to burma where her father, aung san, was still widely remembered. when she visited her mother in the hospital in 1988, she met many of the people who were wounded during the tatmadaw's crackdown in the 8888 uprising. she realises that political change is needed in burma and is soon drawn into the movement to promote reform. she then accepted the role of icon in support of self-determination by the burmese people and devoted herself to activities in support of goals of greater political freedoms.suu kyi founded a political party and clearly won the 1990 elections. however, the burmese military refused to accept the result of the election and moved to bring suu kyi under control. she and her family were separated when her husband and children are banned from burma and she was put under a house arrest for more than a decade. yet their relentless struggling for suu kyi's recognition outside burma is her guarantee she won't be forgotten and cannot disappear unnoticed.
due to her family's efforts, she became the second woman in asia to be awarded the nobel peace prize, the first being mother teresa of india in 1979. yet their separation continued because suu kyi could neither attend the ceremony nor could her husband michael aris see her one last time before his early death.

== background ==

rebecca frayn began working on the project after she and her husband, producer andy harries had visited burma in the early 1990s. harries' production company left bank pictures began development of the script in 2008. harries wanted michelle yeoh as the lead and had the script sent to her. the actress was thrilled because she had always wanted to play suu kyi. she visited london to meet the couple. the script was as british as its origin, telling the story solely from michael aris' perspective but michelle yeoh claimed she brought an asian insight to it. her husband jean todt (who later on also accompanied the project as accredited producer) encouraged her to contact his country fellowman and friend luc besson. besson accepted the script immediately as an opportunity for him to finally present a real life heroine, a female fighter who wields no other weapons than her human virtues.during the shooting of the film, news broke that aung san suu kyi's house arrest had been lifted. luc besson hesitated to believe what he saw on tv because it looked so much like his recent footage. yeoh visited suu kyi soon afterwards. she would say later it had been like visiting a dear family member. when they discussed the film the actress got the feeling she was still on the film set because luc besson had recreated the house so accurately. aung san suu kyi even gave her a hug. on 22 june 2011 yeoh wanted to visit suu kyi a second time but was deported from burma, reportedly over her portrayal of aung san suu kyi. this time besson was allowed to meet suu kyi. suu kyi said she would hesitate to watch the film because she wasn't too sure to be up to it already, although she asked for a copy.


== authenticity ==
writer rebecca frayn interviewed a number of suu kyi's confidants and based her screenplay on the testimonies. some supporters provided frayn information only because she wouldn't disclose these sources, and her work was openly appreciated by suu kyi's brother-in-law anthony aris.to portray suu kyi, michelle yeoh watched about two hundred hours of audiovisual material on suu kyi and took lessons in burmese. her talent for languages is evident when she delivers suu kyi's historic speeches in burmese.
the actress had refreshed her skills as a piano player.
despite always having been petite, michelle yeoh evidently lost weight to embody suu kyi whose son had stressed that his mother was slimmer than yeoh.
as yeoh told the new york post, the silk and cotton costumes she wears are burmese.
luc besson stated later michelle yeoh "had perfected suu kyi's appearance and the nuances of her personality to such an extent that the lines between the real human being and the portrayed character blurred when they crossed in real life".under director luc besson's helm, his crew also pursued accuracy. even the cardinal directions were respected when suu kyi's home was rebuilt, so that the audience would see the sunrise in the same way as suu kyi. based on satellite images and about 200 family photographs they constructed a precise 1:1 scale model of this house.
luc besson himself went to burma, scouted locations and filmed in disguise.
to achieve authenticity luc besson engaged many burmese actors and extras. some of them, like thein win, re-enacted their personal memories. once or twice the filming of a scene had to stop because michelle yeoh's performance of a speech (in burmese) elicited outbursts of emotion among extras who had originally heard suu kyi.co-producer andy harries concentrated on substantiating the british part of his wife's script. he achieved authenticity of the happy time in suu kyi's life, when she lived with her family in the united kingdom. their flat was also recreated on a sound stage, although the film includes scenes shot on location in front of the house itself. the scenes showing michael aris as a dying cancer patient were also shot on location in the actual hospital.
