scarface is a 1983 american crime drama film directed by brian de palma and written by oliver stone. a remake of the 1932 film of the same name, it tells the story of cuban refugee tony montana (al pacino), who arrives penniless in 1980s miami and goes on to become a powerful drug lord. the film co-stars steven bauer, michelle pfeiffer, mary elizabeth mastrantonio and robert loggia. de palma dedicated this version of scarface to the writers of the original film, howard hawks and ben hecht.pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer martin bregman began to develop it. sidney lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by de palma, who hired stone to write the script. filming took place from november 1982 to may 1983, in los angeles. the film's soundtrack was composed by giorgio moroder.
scarface premiered in new york city on december 1, 1983, and was released on december 9, 1983, by universal pictures. the film grossed $45 million at the domestic box office and $66 million worldwide. initial critical reception was negative due to its excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. some cuban expatriates in miami objected to the film's portrayal of cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. in the years that followed, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered by some to be one of the best films in the crime genre, and one of the greatest remakes ever made. screenwriters and directors such as martin scorsese have praised the film, and it has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in hip hop music, as well as comic books, television programs, and video games, although over the years, the film has been regarded as a cult classic.


== plot ==
in 1980, cuban refugee and ex-convict tony montana arrives in miami, florida, as part of the mariel boatlift, where he is sent to a refugee camp with friends manny ray, angel, and chi chi. the four are released and given green cards in exchange for murdering a former cuban general at the request of miami drug lord frank lopez. they become dishwashers at an eatery, but a dissatisfied tony proclaims that he is meant for bigger things.
frank's right-hand man, omar, sends the four to purchase cocaine from colombian dealers, but the deal goes badly. angel is dismembered with a chainsaw, while manny and chi chi rescue tony and kill the colombians. suspecting that omar set them up, tony and manny insist on personally delivering the recovered drugs and money to frank. during their meeting, tony is attracted to frank's trophy wife, elvira. frank hires tony and manny. tony reunites with his mother and younger sister gina, of whom he is overprotective. disgusted by his life of crime, his mother throws him out. manny is attracted to gina, but tony tells him to stay away from her.
frank sends tony and omar to cochabamba, bolivia to meet with cocaine kingpin alejandro sosa. tony negotiates a deal without frank's approval, angering omar. sosa claims that omar is a police informant and that frank has poor judgement; tony witnesses a beaten omar hanged from a helicopter. tony vouches for frank's organization, and sosa, taking a liking to tony, agrees to the deal, but not before warning tony never to betray him.
back in miami, frank is infuriated by omar's demise and the unauthorized deal struck by tony, while tony starts his own independent cocaine operation. at a nightclub, bernstein, a corrupt police detective on frank's payroll, attempts to extort money from tony in return for police protection. tony spots gina fraternizing with a man and beats them both when he sees him grope her. hitmen then attempt to assassinate tony, who escapes but is wounded. he confronts frank and bernstein, certain that they orchestrated the attack; frank confesses his involvement at gunpoint and begs for his life, but he and bernstein are killed by manny and tony, respectively. tony marries elvira and becomes the distributor of sosa's product, using his profits to build a multi-million-dollar business empire and construct a vast, heavily guarded estate.
in 1983, a sting operation by federal agents results in tony being charged with tax evasion with an inevitable prison sentence. sosa offers to use his government connections to keep tony out of prison, but only if tony assassinates an activist intending to expose sosa's drug operations. during a public dinner, tony accuses manny of causing his arrest and elvira of being an infertile junkie, causing elvira to leave him.
tony travels to new york city to carry out the assassination with sosa's henchman, shadow, who plants a radio-controlled bomb under the activist's car. however, when the activist is unexpectedly accompanied by his wife and children, tony tries to call off the hit. shadow refuses to back down, and tony kills him before he can detonate the bomb. tony returns to miami, where an enraged sosa calls him to promise retribution for allowing the activist to deliver the expos. tony, at his mother's behest, tracks down gina and finds her with manny; in a fit of rage, tony shoots manny dead, after which gina tearfully tells tony that they were married the day before. a distraught tony returns to his estate with gina, and begins a massive cocaine binge in his office.
while dozens of sosa's men begin to invade the estate and kill all of tony's guards, gina accuses tony of wanting her for himself and shoots at him. one of sosa's men kills her and is in turn killed by tony. with assassins outside his office, tony turns a grenade launcher-equipped rifle on them, mowing down many. tony is repeatedly shot by the remaining attackers, but continues to taunt them until he is fatally shot from behind by the skull. tony's corpse falls into a fountain below, in front of a statue with the inscription "the world is yours".


== cast ==

additionally, geno silva portrays the assassin who kills tony montana, credited as the skull. richard belzer portrays the babylon club m.c. lana clarkson appears as manny's dance partner at the babylon club. de palma regulars charles durning and dennis franz provided uncredited voiceover dubbing of the immigration and naturalization service officers who interrogate montana in the opening scene.


== production ==


=== development ===

scarface began development after al pacino saw the 1932 film of the same name at the tiffany theater while in los angeles. he later called his manager, producer martin bregman, and informed him of his belief in the potential for a remake of that film. pacino originally wanted to retain the period piece aspect, but realized that because of its melodramatic nature it would be difficult to accomplish. sidney lumet became attached as the director, developing the idea for montana to be cuban arriving in america during the mariel boatlift.bregman and lumet's creative differences saw lumet drop out of the project. lumet had wanted to make a more political story that focused on blaming the current presidential administration for the influx of cocaine into the united states, yet bregman disagreed. bregman replaced him with brian de palma, and hired writer oliver stone; stone had seen the original 1932 scarface and had not enjoyed it, so he initially rejected the offer. only after he talked to lumet was he convinced to accept the offer since they agreed on transforming the film from a period piece to a contemporary film, saying, "sidney had a great idea to take the 1930s american prohibition gangster movie and make it into a modern immigrant gangster movie dealing with the same problems that we had then, that we're prohibiting drugs instead of alcohol. there's a prohibition against drugs that's created the same criminal class as (prohibition of alcohol) created the mafia." in the book the oliver stone experience, stone stated, "i didn't want to do an italian mafia movie ... we'd had dozens of these things. but then bregman came back to me and said, sidney has a great idea  he wants to do it as a marielito picture in miami. i said, that's interesting! sidney's idea was a good one."stone researched the script while battling his own cocaine addiction. he and bregman performed their own research, traveling to miami, florida, where they were given access to records from the u.s. attorney's office and the organized crime bureau. stone moved to paris to write the script, believing he could not break his addiction while in the united states, stating in a 2003 interview that he was completely off drugs at the time "because i don't think cocaine helps writing. it's very destructive to the brain cells."


=== casting ===
pacino insisted on taking the lead role as tony montana, although robert de niro had been offered it and had turned it down. pacino worked with experts in knife combat, trainers, and boxer roberto durn to attain the body type that he wanted for the role. durn also helped inspire the character, who had "a certain lion in him", according to pacino. meryl streep's immigrant character in sophie's choice (1982) also influenced pacino's portrayal of tony montana. bauer and a dialect coach helped him learn aspects of the cuban spanish language and pronunciation.pfeiffer was an unknown actress at the time, and both pacino and de palma had argued against her casting, but bregman fought for her inclusion. glenn close was the original choice for the role, while others were also considered, including geena davis, carrie fisher, kelly mcgillis, sharon stone, and sigourney weaver.bauer got his role without even auditioning. during the audition process, casting director alixe gordin saw bauer and instantly noted that he was right for the role of manny, a judgment with which both de palma and bregman agreed. he was the only actual cuban in the principal cast. john travolta was considered for the role.


=== filming ===
despite the film being set in miami, much of the film was shot in los angeles due to the miami tourist board declining requests to film there as it feared the film would deter tourism to the city with its themes of drugs and gangsters. tony's opulent mansion was el fureidis, a roman-styled mansion near santa barbara, california. the picture was shot over 24 weeks from november 22, 1982 to may 6, 1983. in april 1983, however, a scene was shot at miami's fontainebleau miami beach. the special effects were performed by ken pepiot and stan parks.the production was halted twice for severe weather events in california. during production in march, pacino burned his left hand on the muzzle of the gun that had just been fired when he tripped during a fight scene. production was shut down for more than a week while pacino recovered. a premature bomb explosion also injured two stuntmen during a scene shot in his absence. the gunfight scene at the end of the film also includes a single camera shot directed by steven spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. powdered baby laxative was used as the fake substance for cocaine in the film; pacino's nasal passage was minorly damaged due to snorting large quantities over the course of filming.


=== rating ===
less than two months before the film's release, on october 28, 1983, scarface was given an x rating by the motion picture association of america for "excessive and cumulative violence and for language." de palma had already re-cut the film three times by that point; de palma stated "i said i've had it with these people, i'm not taking any more out." bregman told the new york times, "we have been designated as a pornographic film ... we'll accept the x rating and appeal." universal would not release the film with an x rating due to the porn perception and the reduction of ticket sales being from ticket buyers, most newspapers, tv, and radio stations, who would not run ads for an x-rated film. on november 8, an appeal board composed of 20 theater owners, studio executives and independent distributors overturned the decision 17 to 3 in favor of an r ratingmore than two-thirds required. de palma believed that the changes were minor enough to be unnoticeable, but released the film uncut anyway, only confessing to it months after the film's release.


=== music ===

instead of using popular music from the period in which the film is set, the music in scarface was produced by academy award-winning italian record producer giorgio moroder. reflecting moroder's style, the soundtrack consists mostly of muzak-like synthesized new wave, electronic music. de palma said that he repeatedly denied universal's requests to release the film with a "pop" score because he felt moroder's score was adequate.

=== critical response ===
the original release of scarface was met with a negative critical response, and was criticised for its violence and explicit language. the new york magazine defined it as an empty, bullying, and overblown b movie.writers kurt vonnegut and john irving were among those who walked out in disgust after the notorious chainsaw scene.
at the middle of the film, scorsese turned to bauer and told him, "you guys are great  but be prepared, because they're going to hate it in hollywood ... because it's about them."roger ebert rated it four stars out of four in his 1983 review, and he later added it to his "great movies" list. ebert wrote, "depalma and his writer, oliver stone, have created a gallery of specific individuals, and one of the fascinations of the movie is that we aren't watching crime-movie clichs, we're watching people who are criminals." vincent canby praised the film in the new york times: "the dominant mood of the film is... bleak and futile: what goes up must always come down. when it comes down in scarface, the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting."leonard maltin was among those critics who held a negative opinion of scarface. he gave the film 1 stars out of four, stating that scarface "wallows in excess and unpleasantness for nearly three hours, and offers no new insights except that crime doesn't pay. at least the 1932 movie moved." maltin included an addendum to his review in later editions of his annual movie guide, stating his surprise with the film's newfound popularity as a cult-classic.in his review for newsweek, david ansen wrote, "if scarface makes you shudder, it's from what you think you see and from the accumulated tension of this feral landscape. it's a grand, shallow, decadent entertainment, which like all good hollywood gangster movies delivers the punch and counterpunch of glamour and disgust". jay scott writes in his review for the globe and mail, "for a while, al pacino is hypnotic as montana. but the effort expended on the flawless cuban accent and the attempts to flesh out a character cut from inch-thick cardboard are hopeless." in his review for the washington post, gary arnold wrote, "a movie that appeared intent on revealing an alarmingly contemporary criminal subculture gradually reverts to underworld cliche, covering its derivative tracks with outrageous decor and an apocalyptic, production number finale, ingeniously choreographed to leave the antihero floating face down in a literal bloodbath."on review aggregator rotten tomatoes, the film holds an 82% approval rating based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 7.54/10. the website's critics consensus reads, "director brian de palma and star al pacino take it to the limit in this stylized, ultra-violent and eminently quotable gangster epic that walks a thin white line between moral drama and celebratory excess." metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".


=== depiction of stereotypes ===
during filming, some cubans objected to the film's cuban characters being portrayed as criminals by mostly non-cuban actors. the film featured a disclaimer following its credits stating in red, all-cap lettering "scarface is a fictional account of the activities of a small group of ruthless criminals. the characters do not represent the cuban/american community and it would be erroneous and unfair to suggest that they do. the vast majority of cuban/americans have demonstrated a dedication, vitality and enterprise that has enriched the american scene."in 2008, damarys ocaa of the guardian wrote that the film reinforces stereotypes of marielito cubans, as it exaggerated the number of criminals in the mariel boatlift. she also called pacino's portrayal of a cuban-american as having a "ridiculous accent and overacting." however, of the approximate 125,000 refugees that entered the united states on the boatlift, around 16,000 to 20,000 were estimated to be criminals or "undesirables" according to a 1985 sun sentinel magazine article. in a 1985 report around 350 to 400 mariel cubans were reported to inhabit dade county jails on a typical day.however, demetrio perez, the city commissioner of miami, led the charge against the film. estimates assert that the cuban refugees only included some 2,700 hardened criminals. in the oliver stone experience, stone stated "well, tony montana was a gangster ... his mother and his sister represent the clean-cut cuban community. his mother scolds him: you're a scumbag, get out of my house! you're ruining your sister! so there is a strong morality in the movie. i knew about the criticisms even in advance, that cubans were not like that. but i'm sorry: a lot of cubans did become marielitos. if i'd done it about colombians, they would've said the same thing: 'you're anti-colombian'."

in 1992, wwe hall of famer scott hall joined the world wrestling federation (wwf) as razor ramon, a shady and stylish cuban american bully from miami. the character was modeled after the characters tony montana and manny ribera from scarface. ramon's nickname (the bad guy) and catchphrase ("say hello to the bad guy") derive from montana's quotes: "say hello to my little friend" and "say goodnight to the bad guy". later in his career, hall claimed he pitched the idea of a scarface-like character during a meeting with vince mcmahon and pat patterson, as a joke.bob dylan's 2020 song "my own version of you" references it with the line, "i'll take the scarface pacino and the godfather brando / mix 'em up in a tank and get a robot commando".
