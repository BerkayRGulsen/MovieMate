while working on devdas as an assistant director in 2002, vikramaditya motwane saw sixteen (directed by ken loach, about a troubled teenager who sets out to raise money for a new home). motwane said that the film left "a deep imprint on my mind" and thought, "why couldnt a similar film about a youngster be made in india?" drawing on his own life and surroundings, he wrote a screenplay revolving around a problematic father-son relationship. motwane decided to set the film in the industrial city of jamshedpur when he was struck by the contrast between the area surrounding the tata steel plant and jamshedpur's sister city, adityapur, saying that the former was an "amalgamation of diverse
cultural influences." he wrote the script, described it to his friend anurag kashyap, and realised that "some of the scenes have resemblance to his real life" (like taking a car out at night and having fun with friends). kashyap enjoyed the script and told motwane,"if no one produces it, you come to me, [and] i will do so."motwane signed kashyap as a dialogue writer in 2003, and paid him 10,000 (us$140). he could not find a producer for his film, since it had no commercially-viable actor. kashyap had worked with motwane on his unreleased film, paanch, in which motwane was the song choreographer. since he knew "how good [motwane] was", he decided to produce udaan. motwane had completed the script in 2003, so it took him seven years to find a producer for the film; it was produced by kashyap and sanjay singh under the former's production company, anurag kashyap films. later, ronnie screwvala of utv spotboy represented the film for global sales and distribution at the international film markets. motwane said that many people "wanted to add and subtract things to increase the selling value of the film", with which he did not agree. although kashyap wanted to produce his film, his own films were unreleased.udaan is not autobiographical, but motwane said that the script has traces of his life: "as a first-time writer there was a lot that i took from my own life, in terms of certain themes and references, with observations of friends." he initially made some changes to the script when he looked for financing, and called its final version "a combination of first and second drafts." kashyap told motwane in 2003, after reading the script, that he would solely produce the film. motwane was the co-writer for kashyap's dev.d (2009) before kashyap agreed to produce udaan. he said that it is "one of the few films made on teenagers and their issues growing up", since teen films "usually tackle love stories". for a scene in the film involving rohan's mother, motwane used his wife's photograph. motwane called it a "simple straightforward film" about a boy "who wants to break free from his clutches."newcomer rajat barmecha was cast as rohan after several screen tests by casting director jogi. motwane did not like his initial auditions, but barmecha later improved and was chosen. the film was set and shot extensively in jamshedpur, with a local production crew. it was filmed for 39 days (out of a 42-day shooting schedule) in a hudco bungalow and the circuit house area and also in shimla for three days. the production crew included 13 students and ten actors from the city. the film was shot on super 16 mm film with sync sound. mahendra j. shetty was udaan's director of photography, and dipika kalra was the film's editor; aditya kanwar was its production designer. the film featured ronit roy, aayan boradia, ram kapoor, manjot singh and anand tiwari in supporting roles.
