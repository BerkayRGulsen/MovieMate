== critical reception ==
the radio times wrote "the script turns cartwheels to gain resonance from mrs thatcher's duel with the miners, but to little avail: the picture is "pumped-up" yet irredeemably dull." whereas time out described the film as "one of britain's finest existential thrillers in ages...there are minor flaws, but as a portrait of one man's desperate struggle to survive against all odds, the film is tough, taut and intelligently critical of the man's world it depicts."
