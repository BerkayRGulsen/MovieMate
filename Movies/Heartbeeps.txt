=== development ===
sigourney weaver was offered a role and was interested in the film, as she wanted to work with andy kaufman, but weaver's agent persuaded her to turn down the film.
because of a strike by the screen actors guild, filming was shut down in july 1980 (along with numerous other motion picture and television series). the strike ended at the beginning of october 1980 (filming had started in june).in his book andy kaufman: revealed, bob zmuda wrote that kaufman and zmuda had "pitched" the screenplay of kaufman's the tony clifton story, a movie about the life and times of his alter-ego tony clifton, to universal studios. the universal executives were concerned that kaufman had not acted in films, except for a small role, and arranged for him to star in heartbeeps to test whether he could carry a movie. because the movie was "a box office disaster", plans for making the clifton movie were cancelled.john hill adapted the screenplay into a novel, heartbeeps, published in december 1981.
the film was promoted in magazines such as starlog and famous monsters.
