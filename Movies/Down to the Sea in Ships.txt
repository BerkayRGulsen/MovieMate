== reception ==
the new york times february 23, 1949 review by t. m. p. praised the film, describing the action with relish and concluding:  down to the sea in ships is a good adventure for man and boy, for it makes some points about character building which can do none of us any harm.on december 31, 1948, variety staff observed that the first half is becalmed in thorough character development, but in the last hour, picture really shakes out its sails and goes wing-and-winging before the wind. the taking of a whale and the rendering of blubber to oil, the dangers of fog and the menace of a wreck on an iceberg is sturdy excitement that serves as a fitting climax to the story of an old whaler captain, his young grandson and of a young first mate.leonard maltin gives the film three out of four stars, calling it a good atmospheric yarn.
