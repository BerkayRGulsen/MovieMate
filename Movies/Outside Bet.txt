it is 1985. thatcher is in power, sade is on the radio, and the print workers have gone on strike. but nothing, not even a scale eight earthquake can put a dampener on a group of close friends that meet every sunday in their regular south london pub for a pint and free flowing banter of the highest order. set against the backdrop of a changing way of life-as rupert murdoch moves the printing of his newspapers from fleet street to wapping-this is a tale of seven firm friends, who embark on a unique journey that eventually leads them to gamble all of their savings and redundancy money on a single race.
