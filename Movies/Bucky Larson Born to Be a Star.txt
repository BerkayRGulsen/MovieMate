== plot ==
bucky larson, a small-town manchild with big buck-teeth, stumbles upon a family secret: his quiet and reserved parents were famous porn stars in the 1970s. this motivates him to leave northern iowa for hollywood, hoping to follow in their footsteps and fulfill his destiny as the biggest adult-film star in the world. unfortunately, he has no idea how to become a porn star like his parents, and his penis is incredibly small.
through a series of misunderstandings, he gets a job as a porn actor with fading director miles deep. he makes several films, and achieves a certain fame when his small penis makes women appreciate their partner's endowment. 
along the way he meets and falls in love with kathy, a kindhearted waitress. bucky chooses kathy over fame, but she rejects him without explanation, leaving him brokenhearted. during a film shoot, miles confesses that he had told kathy to leave bucky so he could have his prize star all to himself. 
bucky forgives miles and goes after kathy, who is on a horrible date with another porn star, the well-endowed but narcissistic dick shadow. bucky declares his love for kathy, and the two get married. after one year, bucky opens his own steakhouse. one night, his former roommate comes into the restaurant and yells at him for owing him rent money, and tells bucky he is "just like john mayer".

=== response from swardson ===
swardson defended bucky larson in an october 2011 interview, in which he blamed its poor financial showing on the difficulties of advertising the material: "to promote an r-rated movie, with commercials, with this character, it was just really, really hard. it was hard to get the movie across to people. the trailer in theaters was really tame because we couldn't show any of the insanity, and even if we did it, it wouldn't hit because it had no context. it was just really frustrating." he predicted the film would find more appreciation on dvd.swardson dismissed the negative reviews. "i knew the critics were going to bury us because of the acting, how it was written and directed ... none of those reviewers was psyched to see bucky larson and laugh. they go in with the mentality 'fuck these guys for making another movie.' they go in there to kind of headhunt. it makes me laugh because it's just so embarrassing. it makes them look like such morons."
