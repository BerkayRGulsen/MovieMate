== background ==


=== influences ===
spy kids was influenced by james bond films. director robert rodriguez says the first film was "willy wonka-meets-james bond" and the second was the "mysterious island and james bond mix". technology in the films is portrayed as looking friendly, and a bit cartoonish.
the spy organization featured in the films is called the oss. the initials seem to have been derived from the office of strategic services, a former u.s. intelligence organization during world war ii which later evolved into the cia. note there is a character named donnagon giggles, after william joseph donovan, the director of the real oss. what the initials stand for in the spy kids universe is not specified on screen, but, according to one of the books, they stand for the organization of super spies.


=== themes ===
one of the chief themes of spy kids is the unity of family. the films also play with the idea of children having adult responsibilities, and how keeping secrets from family members can have a negative effect on relationships. the first film also deals extensively with sibling rivalry and the responsibility of older children. it also has a strong sense of latino heritage.


=== technical innovations ===
the other films were shot with high definition digital video, parts of the third film using an anaglyphic process to create the 3-d effects. audiences were given red/blue glasses with their ticket purchase in movie theatres. four sets of these glasses were also included in the dvd release. the third film was also used as a test for a special texas instruments digital projector which is supposed to be able to project polarized 3d, a process that does not require the red-blue lenses, which was later reused for the adventures of sharkboy and lavagirl in 3-d (2005).
