=== critical reception ===
the film received overall positive reviews. the times of india gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, "there is scope for an interesting black comedy in this plot but aadama jaichomada often feels less quirky and less funny than it should have been. it is as if the makers decided to stick to the lowest possible yardstick and were satisfied for managing to cross it. as a result, many of the jokes do not work that well...we are amused..we smile...we chuckle...but we never truly laugh non-stop". the new indian express wrote, "laced with dark humour, aadama jaichomada keeps one entertained for the most part. taking just about two hours of viewing time, aadama jaichomada has its good moments and is a breezy watch". rediff gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, "the characters and the situation they unwittingly get themselves into, is well thought out, and cleverly woven into the screenplay. the narrative too is totally unpredictable, keeping you guessing. at just two hours, the story moves at a brisk pace", going on to add that the film "does work as an entertainer". sify wrote, "the film works for its performances of karunakaran, balaji and the interactions between the bumbling cops simhaa, ks ravikumar and chetan. there is something quirky about it that makes the film a watchable fun ride. aadama jaichomada is like a t:20 match fast and thoroughly enjoyable". ians gave 3 stars and wrote, "aadama jaichomada, at two hours, attempts to be a crime-thriller as well as a sports-based comedy. but it only succeeds as the latter, and fails to do justice to the former form...despite a weak story, the humour in aadama jaichomada will bowl over the movie buffs". the hindu wrote, "picture yourself reading an average joke book. you flip page after page, reading the jokes, many of which barely evoke a smile. just as you decide to try one last one before flinging the book away, you find a tickler that gets you laughing. aadama jaichomada is this joke book that surprises you with a witty line or funny joke just when you are resigned to expecting nothing". cinemalead rated a 2.5 out of 5 and wrote,"short and fun"
