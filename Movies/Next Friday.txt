the trio drug the jokers guard dog chico. craig sneaks into the jokers house while the three brothers are partying. craig locates the pump and confirms that cash is hidden inside, taking some for himself. he escapes out of a window. meanwhile, day-day and roach knock on the jokers front door, which is answered by all three brothers armed with guns. the brothers take day-day and roach hostage while trying to figure out what happened to their money.
