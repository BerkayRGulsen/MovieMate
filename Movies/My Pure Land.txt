nazo dharejo lives on a farm in rural sindh, with her parents, two sisters, and an older brother. early in the film, her father encourages his daughters as well as his son to value the land and be prepared to defend it: ""no matter what happens, you need to protect this land. this isn't just land. this is your honour." after nazo's father and brother are arrested, a scheming uncle tries to lay claim to the family farm. nazo, with her mother and sisters, defends their land, even when it is attacked by 200 mercenaries, hired by the uncle.
