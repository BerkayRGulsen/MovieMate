hulk is a 2003 american superhero film based on the marvel comics character of the same name, directed by ang lee and written by james schamus, michael france, and john turman from a story by schamus. eric bana stars as bruce banner/hulk, alongside jennifer connelly, sam elliott, josh lucas, and nick nolte. the film explores bruce banner's origins. after a lab accident involving gamma radiation, he transforms into a giant green-skinned creature whenever emotionally provoked or stressed. the united states military pursues him, and he clashes with his biological father, who has dark plans for his son.
development for the film started as far back as 1990. at one point, joe johnston and then jonathan hensleigh were to direct the movie. hensleigh, john turman, michael france, zak penn (who would later write the incredible hulk), j. j. abrams, michael tolkin, david hayter, scott alexander, and larry karaszewski wrote more scripts before ang lee and james schamus' involvement. from march to august 2002, hulk was primarily shot in california, mainly in the san francisco bay area.
the film was released on june 20, 2003, and it grossed $245 million worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 2003.  rotten tomatoes' critical consensus calls it an ambitious and stylish film that focuses too much on dialogue at the cost of action. a planned sequel was repurposed as a reboot, titled the incredible hulk, and released on june 13, 2008, as the second film in the marvel cinematic universe.


== plot ==
david banner is a genetics researcher for the government trying to improve human dna. his supervisor, general thaddeus "thunderbolt" ross, forbids human experimentation, so david experiments on himself. his wife, edith, soon gives birth to their son bruce. david realizes bruce inherited his mutant dna and attempts to find a cure. after discovering his dangerous experiments, ross shuts down david's research; david rigs desert base's gamma reactor to explode as revenge. believing bruce is dangerous, david tries to kill him but accidentally murders edith as she tried to protect bruce; the trauma causes bruce to suppress his early childhood memories. ross arrests david, sending him to a mental hospital, and puts the 4-year-old bruce into foster care. mrs. krenzler adopts him, and bruce assumes the surname, growing up believing his birth parents are dead.
thirty years later, bruce is a brilliant scientist working at the berkeley lab with his ex-girlfriend and ross's estranged daughter, betty ross. representing the private research company atheon, the shady glenn talbot becomes interested in the scientists' nanomeds research to create regenerating soldiers for the military-industrial complex. david reappears, working as a janitor in the lab building to infiltrate bruce's life. ross begins investigating and becomes concerned for betty's safety around bruce.
bruce saves betty and their colleague harper from an accident with a malfunctioning gammasphere. waking in a hospital bed, bruce tells betty he feels better than ever, but betty can't fathom his survival since the nanomeds killed everything else they've touched; unknown to them, the radiation merged with bruce's altered dna. david meets him after hours, revealing their relationship and hinting at bruce's mutation. he later uses samples of bruce's dna for animal experimentation. bruce's increasing rage from the tensions mounting around him activates his gamma-radiated dna; he becomes the hulk and destroys the lab. betty finds bruce unconscious in his home the following morning, barely remembering last night. a suspicious ross arrives later to question bruce before betty locates david to investigate him. after hours of interrogation, ross seizes the lab and places bruce under house arrest. david calls bruce that night, revealing he mutated his three dogs and sicced them on betty, enraging him. then talbot attacks bruce about the lab; bruce transforms and injures talbot and ross's mps. the hulk finds betty at her forest cabin and shares a moment with her before the dogs arrive, and he fights and kills them before changing back into bruce.
betty calls ross the following day; the army sedates and takes bruce to desert base. deeming bruce "damned" to follow in david's footsteps, ross is doubtful about helping him, but betty persuades him to let her try and help bruce control his changes. meanwhile, david subjects himself to the nanomeds and gammasphere, becoming able to meld with and absorb the properties of anything he touches. talbot takes control from ross, forcing betty to return home. seeking to profit from the hulk's power, talbot fails to provoke bruce and puts him in an isolation tank. david confronts betty at her house, offering to surrender himself and asking to speak to bruce "one last time" in exchange. talbot induces a nightmare from bruce's repressed memories and triggers a transformation. trapping the hulk in sticky foam, talbot tries taking a sample of him, but the hulk's rage enlarges him, and he breaks free. talbot fires an explosive round at him, but it rebounds into a back wall and explodes, killing talbot, and ross resumes command. the hulk escapes the base, battles the army in the desert, and leaps to san francisco to find betty, who convinces ross to take her to the hulk, returning bruce to normal.
david and bruce talk at a base in the city while ross watches, threatening to incinerate them. david has descended into megalomania, wanting bruce's power to destroy his enemies. after bruce refuses, david bites into a high-voltage cable when ross powers it and absorbs the energy, mutating into a powerful electrical creature. bruce becomes the hulk and fights him at pear lake; david tries absorbing the hulk's power, but the hulk overpowers him. ross orders a gamma charge bomb to end the fight, killing david. a year later, ross has betty under constant surveillance, and  bruce is in exile in the amazon rainforest as a medical camp doctor. when a group arrives to steal the medical supplies, bruce warns them they wouldn't like him when he's angry, and his eyes glow green.

=== development ===


==== jonathan hensleigh ====
producers avi arad and gale anne hurd began developing hulk in 1990, the same year the final tv movie based on the 1970s tv series aired. they set the property up at universal pictures in 1992. michael france and stan lee were invited into universal's offices in 1993, with france writing the script. universal's concept was to have the hulk battle terrorists, an idea france disliked. john turman, a hulk comic book fan, was brought to write the script in 1994, getting lee's approval. heavily influenced by the tales to astonish issues, turman wrote ten drafts and pitted the hulk against general ross and the military and  the leader, also including rick jones and the atomic explosion origin from the comics along with brian banner as the explanation for bruce's inner anger. universal had mixed feelings over turman's script, but future screenwriters would use many elements.hurd brought her husband jonathan hensleigh as co-producer the following year, and universal hired industrial light & magic to create the hulk with computer-generated imagery. universal was courting france once more to write the screenplay but changed their minds when joe johnston became the director in april 1997. the studio wanted hensleigh to rewrite the script due to his successful results on johnston's jumanji. universal fired france before he wrote a single page but gave him a buy-off. johnston dropped out of directing in july 1997 in favor of october sky, and hensleigh convinced universal to make the hulk his directing debut. universal brought turman back a second time to write two more drafts. zak penn then rewrote it. his script featured a fight between the hulk and a school of sharks, and two scenes he eventually used for the 2008 film: banner realizing he cannot have sex and triggering a transformation by falling out of a helicopter. hensleigh rewrote from scratch, coming up with a brand new storyline featuring bruce banner, who, before the accident which turns him into the hulk, experiments with gamma-irradiated insect dna on three convicts, transforming them into "insect men" that cause havoc.

filming was to start in december 1997 in arizona for a summer 1999 release date, but filming was pushed back for four months. hensleigh subsequently rewrote the script with j. j. abrams. scott alexander and larry karaszewski were also brought on board to rewrite, with hensleigh still attached as director. in october 1997, hulk had entered pre-production with the creation of prosthetic makeup and computer animation already underway. gregory sporleder was cast as "novak", banner's archenemy, while lynn "red" williams was cast as a convict who transforms into a combination of human, ant, and beetle. in march 1998, universal put hulk on hiatus due to its escalating $100 million budget and worries of hensleigh directing his first film. $20 million was already spent on script development, computer animation, and prosthetics work. hensleigh immediately went to rewrite the script to lower the budget.


==== michael france ====
hensleigh found the rewriting process too complicated and dropped out, feeling he "wasted nine months in pre-production". it took another eight months for france to convince universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for the third time. france claimed, "someone within the universal hierarchy wasn't sure if this was a science fiction adventure, or a comedy, and i kept getting directions to write both. i think that at some point when i wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a jim carrey or adam sandler movie." france was writing the script on the fast track from julyseptember 1999. filming for hulk was to start in april 2000.france stated his vision of the film was different from the other drafts, which based bruce banner on his "amiable, nerdy genius" incarnation in the 1960s. france cited inspiration from the 1980s hulk stories, which introduced brian banner, bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. his script had banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities to convince himself that he is not like his father. however, he has anger management issues before the hulk is born, which makes everything worse. the "don't make me angry..." line from the tv series became the dialogue that banner's father would say before beating his son. elements such as the "gammasphere," bruce and betty's tragic romance, and the black ops made it to the final film. france turned in his final drafts in late 1999  january 2000.


==== ang lee ====
michael tolkin and david hayter rewrote the script afterward, despite the producers' positive response over france's script. tolkin was brought in january 2000, while universal brought hayter in september of that year. hayter's draft featured the leader, zzzax, and the absorbing man as the villains, who are depicted as banner's colleagues and get caught in the same accident that creates the hulk. director ang lee and his producing partner james schamus became involved with the film on january 20, 2001. lee was dissatisfied with hayter's script and commissioned schamus for a rewrite, merging banner's father with the absorbing man. lee cited influences from king kong, frankenstein, jekyll and hyde, beauty and the beast, faust, and greek mythology to interpret the story. schamus said he had found the storyline that introduced brian banner, allowing lee to write a drama that again explored father-son themes.schamus was still rewriting the script in october 2001. in early 2002, as filming was underway, michael france read all the scripts for the writers guild of america to determine who would get final credit. france criticized schamus and hayter for claiming they were aiming to make banner a more in-depth character, saddened they had denigrated his and turman's work in interviews. schamus elected to get solo credit. france felt, "james schamus did a significant amount of work on the screenplay. for example, he brought in the hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use banner's father as a real character in the present. but he used quite a lot of elements from john turman's scripts and quite a lot from mine, and that's why we were credited." france, turman, and schamus received final credit. in december 2001, a theatrical release date for june 20, 2003, was announced, with the film's title as the hulk.


=== filming ===
filming began on march 18, 2002, in arizona and moved on april 19 to the san francisco bay area. locations included advanced light source, lawrence berkeley national laboratory, oakland, treasure island military base, and the sequoia forests of porterville, before several weeks in the utah and california deserts. the penultimate battle scene between hulk and his father used the real pear lake in sequoia national park as a backdrop. filming then moved to the universal backlot in los angeles, using stage 12 for the water tank scene, before finishing in the first week of august. filming of hulk constituted hiring 3,000 local workers, generating over $10 million into the local economy. mychael danna, who previously collaborated with lee on ride with the devil and the ice storm, was set to compose the film score before dropping out. then danny elfman was hired.eric bana commented that the shoot was "ridiculously serious... a silent set, morbid in a lot of ways." lee told him that he was shooting a greek tragedy: he would be making a "whole other movie" about the hulk at industrial light & magic. an example of lee's arthouse approach to the film was taking bana to watch a bare-knuckle boxing match. computer animation supervisor dennis muren was on the set every day. one of the many visual images in the film that presented an acting challenge for bana was lee's split-screen technique to mimic comic book page panels cinematically. this technique required many more takes of individual scenes than usual. muren and other ilm animators used previous technology from harry potter and the chamber of secrets (for the dobby character) to create the hulk with computer-generated imagery. additional software used included poweranimator, softimage 3d, softimage xsi, and pixar's renderman. ilm started computer animation work in 2001 and completed it in may 2003, just one month before the film's release. lee provided some motion capture work in post-production. gary rydstrom handled sound design at skywalker sound.

=== film score ===

danny elfman composed the film score for hulk after scoring spider-man the previous year. frequent ang lee collaborator mychael danna was the film's original composer; however, studio executives rejected danna's score for its non-traditional approach, which featured japanese taiko, african drumming, and arabic singing. then elfman was approached by universal's president of film music, kathy nelson. with 37 days to compose over two hours of music, elfman agreed out of respect to lee. while instructing to retain much of the character of danna's score, lee pushed elfman to write material that didn't sound like his previous superhero scores. "they did leave some of my music in the movie," said danna, "so the arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine. what happened is that they panicked, they brought in danny and he heard what i've been doing and i guess he liked it."a soundtrack album was released on june 17, 2003, by decca records. it features the song "set me free" by velvet revolver, which plays during the end credits.

== future ==


=== cancelled sequel ===
during filming, producer avi arad targeted a may 2005 theatrical release date for a sequel. upon the film's release, screenwriter james schamus started to plan a sequel featuring hulk's grey hulk persona and considered using the leader and the abomination as villains. marvel asked for abomination's inclusion to be an actual threat to hulk, unlike general ross. however, aside from hulk's mixed reception, universal didn't meet the established deadline for filming a sequel to ang lee's film.


=== marvel cinematic universe ===

in january 2006, marvel studios reacquired the film rights to the character, and writer zak penn began work on a sequel titled the incredible hulk. however, edward norton rewrote penn's script after signing on to star, retelling the origin story in flashbacks and revelations, to establish the film as a reboot; director louis leterrier agreed with this approach. leterrier acknowledged that the only remaining similarity between the two films was bruce hiding in south america.
