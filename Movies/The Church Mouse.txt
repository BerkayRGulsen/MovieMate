== critical reception ==
writing for the spectator in 1936, graham greene praised the film as "an admirable film" sadly partnered as makeweight to i give my heart (a film greene characterized as appalling). comparing the character of perry mason to other similar fictional detectives like sherlock holmes, lord peter wimsey, charlie chan, and those created by william powell, greene concludes that mason is his favorite film detective because he is a more genuine creation and recommends the film as "good mason if not good detection".
