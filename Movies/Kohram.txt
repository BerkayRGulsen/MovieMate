== production ==
after his film mrityudata (1997) flopped at the box office, director mehul kumar wanted to make another film with amitabh bachchan. both these films were produced by amitabh bachchan corporation. this is when he came up with the idea for kohram. the original cast announced consisted of dimple kapadia, arshad warsi and karisma kapoor with the working title as "aye watan tere liye". however, later that was scrapped and this film was made. initially, nana patekar had declined kumar's offer, but later agreed to do the film. initially the film was slated to release on 6th august, but then mehul kumar advanced it to 13th august.


== critical reception ==
kohram received mixed reviews but was received better than mrityudaata, kumar's previous film. while only 16% users liked it on rotten tomatoes, critic ajay chaturvedi called it an average film. he said that while the first half is good, the second half is jarringly edited, but the film is a treat for nana patekar fans. he also appreciated tabu's performance in the film.


== box office ==
kohram grossed 133 million at the box office, while its collections in u.s were $70,257. it performed some good in interiors but couldn't do much and finally declared a flop.
