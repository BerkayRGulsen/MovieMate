== plot ==
the setting of the film is an isolated farm in doylestown, pennsylvania. former episcopal priest graham hess (mel gibson) lives there with his asthmatic preteen son morgan (rory culkin) and younger daughter bo (abigail breslin). graham's younger brother merrill (joaquin phoenix), a failed minor-league baseball player, has been living on the farm to help out since graham's wife colleen died in a traffic accident six months earlier, shown in a series of flashbacks. graham has since lost his religious faith and abandoned the church.
large crop circles appear in the hess's cornfield that are initially attributed to vandals. soon after, other crop circles, eventually determined to be navigational guides, appear globally, and lights from invisible objects hover over mexico and other cities later on. one night, graham and merrill chase a tall dark figure that disappears into the field. graham later glimpses another one among the corn stalks, and strange clicking noises are heard over bo's old baby monitor. in brazil, an alien is filmed during a child's birthday party.
ray reddy (m. night shyamalan), the man responsible for colleen's fatal accident, calls the hess house but hangs up. graham goes to investigate, finding reddy sitting inside his car. reddy expresses remorse for colleen's death and graham losing his faith. as he is about to drive to a lake, believing the aliens avoid water, reddy warns graham that a creature is locked inside his pantry. graham investigates, using a large kitchen knife to peer under the pantry door. as he is about to leave he thinks twice and goes back to try and get a better look.  the alien reaches under the door to try and attack him, but graham cuts off the end of several of its fingers with the knife.
as a worldwide alien invasion begins, the hesses barricade themselves inside their house. as several aliens break into the house, the family retreats to the basement. morgan has an asthma attack but survives the night, despite being without his medication. the family emerge the next morning after radio reports say the aliens have abruptly abandoned earth, stranding some aliens. the alien which had been trapped inside ray reddy's pantry, identified by its missing fingertips, enters the house and takes morgan hostage. recalling colleen's dying words, graham tells merrill to "swing away", using his baseball bat. the alien sprays morgan with a toxic gas from its wrist. graham recovers his stricken son as merrill bashes the creature, hitting it into glasses of water left by bo, the liquid scalding its skin. merrill continues hitting the creature, eventually killing it. outside, morgan revives after graham administers his medication. morgan's constricted lungs prevented him inhaling the alien's toxins, an act graham attributes to god's intervention.
months later, the hess family has recovered from the ordeal. in the final scene, graham is seen as having returned to the church, his faith restored.

=== critical reception for soundtrack ===
the soundtrack generally received positive reviews. william ruhlmann of allmusic stated in his review that: with signs, composer james newton howard again joins director m. night shyamalan for their third collaboration following the sixth sense and unbreakable, and clearly the film presents another thrilling encounter with the supernatural. from his opening "main theme," howard ratchets up the tension, and his music thereafter alternates only between the ominous and the suspenseful. he overloads his lower tones, employing eight basses, five percussionists, and even a tuba, but also uses a large string section for short, fast, repetitive figures meant to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. this is not particularly imaginative music, just good old saturday afternoon scary movie fare, the only distinguishing characteristic about it -- consistent with shyamalan's style -- that it is so relentless. there's just no let up; dread pervades every moment of the director's films, to the point of emotional exhaustion for some, and the score has to have the same uncompromising approach, which can make it a little hard to take when listened to all the way through.

=== critical response ===
signs has received positive reviews from film critics. rotten tomatoes reported that 74% gave positive appraisals based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 6.80/10. the site's critical consensus reads, "with signs, shyamalan proves once again an expert at building suspense and giving audiences the chills." at metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film scored a 59 based on 36 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".roger ebert gave the film four stars, writing "m. night shyamalan's signs is the work of a born filmmaker, able to summon apprehension out of thin air. when it is over, we think not how little has been decided, but how much has been experienced ... at the end of the film, i had to smile, recognizing how shyamalan has essentially ditched a payoff. he knows, as we all sense, that payoffs have grown boring." nell minow of common sense media gave the film four out of five stars; she praised the casting and shyamalan's direction, saying his "only flaw was not leaving anything to the audience's imagination".mike lasalle of the san francisco chronicle gave the film one star out of four, thinking that the film had "few thoughts and no thrills." variety's todd mccarthy criticised the film for its lack of originality, writing "after the overwrought unbreakable and now the meager signs, it's fair to speculate whether shyamalan's persistence in replicating the otherworldly formula of the sixth sense might not be a futile and self-defeating exercise."in 2004, the film was listed as no. 77 on bravo's the 100 scariest movie moments for the brazilian birthday party scene.


=== box office ===
signs grossed $227,966,634 domestically and $180,281,283 internationally, which would total up to $408,247,917 worldwide at the box office, ranking only behind the sixth sense in shyamalan's box office success and grossing more than the village and split.


=== home media ===
signs was released on vhs and dvd on january 7, 2003.
on the dvd, there are some deleted scenes:

flashbacks 1 and 2: two scenes with graham's wife, colleen. in the first, she sits with a toddler morgan and baby bo in a rocking chair while graham watches. in the second, she dances with him. she hums the same tune in both scenes.
the dead bird: with no sound, this scene shows graham going back home from ray's, and after a short time, a dead bird near the road (after supposedly hitting an invisible forcefield) is shown.
the attic door and the third story: the longest one, it starts with merrill finding out about the not-boarded attic door. despite graham's efforts to call him back, merrill goes up the stairs and manages to hold the door by climbing up a chair and putting his hands at the door. trying to help, graham looks for a way to hold the door. he gets a tall shelf and places it under the door. knowing this is only a temporary solution, graham gets his family and takes them to the kitchen and puts some chairs at the door to hold the aliens out of the room. there, he tells the "third story", about merrill, in which he dislocated his arm. while graham is telling the story, the shelf is destroyed from the attic door slamming on top of it repeatedly and the aliens gain access to the house. everyone goes down to the basement, the only safe room available, as the aliens begin forcing the kitchen door open.
