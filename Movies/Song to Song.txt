== reception ==
song to song has polarized film critics. on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes, it has a 43% approval rating based on 122 critics and an average rating of 5.37/10. the site's critical consensus reads, "as visually sumptuous as it is narratively spartan, terrence malick's song to song echoes elements of the writer-director's recent workfor better and for worse." on metacritic the film holds a rating of 54 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".in a five-star review for the independent, christopher hooton claimed that it has become fashionable among critics to ridicule malick's recent films, but that given a chance the film is a "masterpiece" and even "life-changing". in entertainment weekly, joe mcgovern derided it as "incoherent, disconnected, self-interrupting, obsessed with pointless minutiae and crammed full of odd, limp stabs at profundity [...] youll find yourself searching in the margins of each shot for something or someone tangible to grasp onto."film critic matt zoller seitz of rogerebert.com gave the film two and a half out of four stars. although he had always praised malick's work and style in the past ("i don't believe that the austin-based director has ever made a bad movie"), he wrote that song to song "is the first malick film ive watched where the dots never came together to form a legible image", emphasizing the film's need for more "rhetorical connective tissue" that would further connect to the film's themes as well as better characterizations, because of the film's highly chaotic nature. seitz concluded that the film is "a brainy concept album made up of b-sides and filler. the musicianship is superb but the songs needed work."
