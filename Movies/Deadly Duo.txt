== background ==
the film is one of a group of historical near-epics from 1970-73 that were directed by chang cheh and starred by ti lung and david chiang, which included the heroic ones, new one-armed swordsman and blood brothers. the deadly duo is considerably shorter than the others, and arguably with less emphasis in the way of characterization and plotting and more in the way of fighting, action and adventure.
all the fights involve various weapons, mostly spears and swords, but also some exotic devices such as a pair of lethal cymbals and a container that shoots out incendiary balls. the co-director of the action scenes is lau kar-leung (a.k.a. liu chia liang), who had a special interest in spear and stick fighting and went on to direct some of the most renowned kung fu films of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
