=== context ===
"all this was in the early eighties and we are now in 2013 and since there is almost no underworld now, it is clear that there's a vacuum and whenever there's a vacuum in any lucrative business there will always be an entrepreneur to step in.
if satya was a story of a man who came in 1998 and shaped the then existing underworld, 'satya 2' is about another man who comes in 2013 to reinvent the underworld. to that extent i would say this is a futuristic film not in terms of science fiction but in terms of that there's no precedent for the protagonist of 'satya 2'. he starts a new underworld company based on his study of the mistakes of all the earlier dons and also on the ways he develops to deal with the modern day policing methods" said ram gopal varma.
"the police is completely caught off guard by this never before experienced menace of the new company and the reason for this is that the police will always be lesser than a criminal enterprise in their vision ...that is because the police is merely an evolved system whereas a criminal entrepreneur for want of a better word is a visionary in his own field. only after a new kind of crime happens will the police learn how to contain or prevent it. so it follows that if a completely new kind of a criminal appears on the horizon, their past experience will be null and void and they will again have to start from scratch
so in one line 'satya 2' is about a man whose thinking starts where the earlier dons thinking ended and where the police cannot even begin to think." said ram gopal varma.


== production ==
"as a film maker i have been doing a deep study of the underworld and its gangsters for more than two decades primarily for the purposes of gathering subject matters for my films and to get inspired for characters from real life references..and that's how films like satya and company happened... then one day it occurred to me what if a guy out there studied the same gangsters not for becoming a film maker but for the purpose of becoming a gangster himself.it's that idea of mine which finally shaped itself into satya 2. a new age gangster will obviously be armed with the mistakes of the earlier gangsters and also with the modern day policing methods". said ram gopal varma. one romantic song of satya 2 was shot in kashmir in june 2013. the central board of film certification (cbfc) passed satya 2 with a certificate with 3 cuts. satya 2 is made within the budget of rs 15 crore.
