== production background ==
slaves in bondage is a low-budget, independently produced exploitation film presented as a cautionary tale about the evils of white slavery prostitution rings operating in larger cities in the united states. to avoid local censorship issues, the film's dialogue does not use the words brothel or prostitution.
the film is typical of the many exploitation film features of its time that claimed to warn the public about various kinds of shocking sin and depravity corrupting today's society. in reality, these films were cynical, profit-motivated vehicles that wallowed in lurid, taboo subjects such as drug abuse, promiscuous sex, venereal disease, polygamy, child marriages, etc. some even included brief nude scenes such as sex madness (1937), marihuana (1936), and assassin of youth (1937), which were also directed by elmer clifton.
