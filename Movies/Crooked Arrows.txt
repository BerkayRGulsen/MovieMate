daniel m. gold from the new york times wrote that: "crooked arrows gets points for its glimpses of native american culture and history  the films backers include the onondaga nation  but too many of these scenes are disappointingly static. and the games themselves give little sense of the flow or exquisite precision of lacrosse. splitting the difference between heritage film and sports flick, crooked arrows gets neither right, whiffing at an open net."
