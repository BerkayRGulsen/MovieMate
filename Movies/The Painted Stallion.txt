the painted stallion is a 1937 republic movie serial.  it was the sixth republic serial of the sixty-six made by that company.  western serials such as this made up a third of the serials from republic, a studio that was also heavily involved in making b-western feature films at the time.
this serial saw the directorial debut of william witney, who would become one of the star directors at republic.  it was not until zorro rides again, later in 1937, that he first worked with his famous directorial partner, john english.  witney had been working as an editor on earlier serials but made the switch when another director became unable to work due to heavy drinking.

== critical reception ==
raymond stedman describes thyer as quiet yet impressive and william nobles is noted for his sweeping camera work. raoul krausharr's musical score is a bridge between the "synthetic fusions" of earlier sound serials and the "creative scorings" of his successors at republic.  according to cline, the painted stallion is an outstanding example of the western "covered wagon" (wagon train based) subgenre.
