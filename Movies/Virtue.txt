== plot ==
set in the early 1930s, larita (jessica biel) meets john whittaker (ben barnes) in monaco. they marry and he takes his bride to the family mansion near flintham in rural nottinghamshire to meet his mother, veronica whittaker (kristin scott thomas) and father, major jim whittaker (colin firth) and his two sisters, hilda (kimberley nixon) and marion (katherine parkinson). veronica, already predisposed to dislike her new daughter-in-law, is further disappointed to find that she, like jim, speaks fluent french. larita also meets john's former girlfriend and neighbour sarah hurst (charlotte riley), who is gracious about the marriage.
larita makes some inadvertent gaffes, accidentally killing the family chihuahua and giving some joking advice to hilda that unfortunately results in embarrassment to, and enmity from, the sisters. sarah comes to the whittakers' parties, and to play tennis, accompanied by her brother philip (christian brassington), on whom hilda has a crush. philip, however, is infatuated with larita, which further angers hilda. larita reveals she has been previously married and remains calm in the face of her mother-in-law's disdain. to larita's disappointment, john is not eager to leave the estate so that they can find a home of their own. larita is bored and miserable in the countryside and hates blood sports like hunting, and any of the entertainment that country english people seem to enjoy. she reads lady chatterley's lover, shocking the female relatives, and she will not play tennis. she dislikes veronica's stuffy decor, her constant entertaining of her friends, and the overcooked food. she tries to get along with veronica who refuses to accept her and resents her attempts to bring american traditions into the home.
veronica and her hunting party discover john and larita having sex in an outbuilding. larita becomes increasingly isolated and demoralized by her mother-in-law's derision, verbal attacks and dirty tricks. apart from jim, larita's only friends are the servants, whom she treats better than veronica does. larita retreats to jim's workshop to work on his motorcycle. still troubled from having lost all his men in the great war, jim has lost interest in the estate. any love between him and his wife has long since disappeared. the whittakers have fallen on hard times. john loses his independence and seems immature as he is drawn into family life. john's affection for larita seems to be waning, as he complains about his wife to sarah, who finds his overture inappropriate.
hilda receives a newspaper cutting from her uncle in america revealing information about larita's first husband, an older man dying of cancer. john withdraws from larita, while jim scolds his daughters for their cruelty. at veronica's christmas party, john refuses to dance with larita, so jim dances a tango with her. she determines to leave the marriage, and on her way out of the mansion, she apologizes to sarah for having interrupted her relationship with john. she hopes that sarah will take john back. veronica and her daughters confront larita one last time, and an argument ensues in which veronica and larita trade barbs, and larita advises the daughters to leave and see the world, in their own eyes, while they still can. larita destroys a large statue as she leaves the house, with a heartbroken john onlooking. jim goes with her in her car and furber (kris marshall) wishes them both well.

=== writing ===
coward's play was adapted to the screen by stephan elliott and sheridan jobbins but hardly any feature of the original play remains besides the main characters, and even they do not greatly resemble coward's cast.
in his autobiography, present indicative published in 1937, coward describes his object in the play as being "to compare the dclasse woman of to-day with the more flamboyant demi-mondaine of the 1890s." he goes on to say, "the line that was intended to establish the play on a basis of comedy rather than tragedy, comes at the end of the second act when larita, the heroine, irritated beyond endurance by the smug attitude of her 'in-laws', argues them out of the room."although the play was made into a silent film in 1928 directed by alfred hitchcock and starring isabel jeans and franklin dyall, this film is not mentioned in coward's autobiography. the 2008 version of the film is favourably reviewed by the nol coward society.


=== directing ===
filmmaker stephan elliott instructed kristin scott thomas to play mrs. whittaker as a "mustache-twirling... disney witch." initially, the actress responded by suggesting this is the worst direction she had ever received, but later embraced her character's wickedness and somewhat haggard appearance and unflattering wardrobe.


=== shooting ===
the film was shot in studio at the ealing studios in london, and on location at:

flintham hall, flintham, nottinghamshire (whittaker estate)
wimpole hall, cambridgeshire (hurst estate)
englefield house, berkshire (monte carlo)

=== critical response ===
review aggregation website rotten tomatoes gives the film a score of 53% based on 120 reviews. metacritic gives the film a score of 58% based on reviews from 28 critics.colm andrew of the manx independent gave the film 7/10 and said it was "a frothy affair but the source material is goodthe script is workmanlike but at least it doesn't try to be clever and the quality of the acting makes sure the lines resonate soundly". some critics felt that the movie's insistent jazz-age lilt is ultimately at odds with a play written in 1924 that attacks the hypocrisy, smugness and benighted values of the english landed gentry between the wars. the screenplay includes scattered coward bons mots, but the witticisms don't come as thick or as fast as in his later plays.broadsheet and national british reviews were generally mixed or negative. film four's praised the casting of biel and noted that, though firth's and thomas's casting was "hardly radical thinking, both offer something different from their previous period work". philip french of the observer wrote that  the film was "well enough designed and photographed, but witless, anachronistic, cloth-eared, lacking in both style and period sense", while peter bradshaw of the guardian attacked its script for "undermin[ing] the material by slipping arch modern phrases and gags into everyone's mouths". the critic of the times awarded it only one star out of five, whilst nicholas barber of the independent wrote that "every one of elliott's straining efforts to turn easy virtue into a zany, risqu farce only makes it seems stuffier and starchier".  stella papamichael of digital spy added that british jazz renditions of "car wash" and "sex bomb" used in the film were totally distracting.
