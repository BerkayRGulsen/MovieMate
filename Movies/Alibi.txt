== production ==
lockwood had just given birth to her daughter. it was the first time lockwood worked with james mason. she said mason wanted star billing and was unhappy at being given feature billing. she said the film "was anything but a success" but enjoyed working with him saying he "was a wonderful artist and extremely easy to work with. he was one of the people who helped me to enjoy making that rather bad film and to enjoy getting back into the routine of my work again." lockwood and james mason would shortly become huge stars with the man in grey.


== critical reception ==
in a contemporary review, the monthly film bulletin wrote, "here is a bright film with a bit of everything in it...the film is well directed, and margaret lockwood makes an appealing helene, with james mason playing opposite to her. raymond lovell is first-class as the sinister winkler, and rodney ackland as his assistant and principal villain no. 2, plays up to him well, introducing an element of melodrama. the other members of the cast team up to make the whole a creditable production."
