tv guide wrote: "this decent crime drama was written and directed by john gilling, known for his efficient low-budget adventures and thrillers." 
britmovie calls the film a "decent if unremarkable second-feature crime drama featuring irish actor dermot walsh...walsh's father is played by experienced character actor charles victor, who performs his role with quiet, self-effacing distinction."
the film historians steve chibnall and brian mcfarlane note that "the film won considerable praise for being authentically staged, effectively directed, 'thrilling and human'.".
