== critical reaction ==
the film is described by critics as a psychological thriller in the same vein as david cronenberg, memento, and jacob's ladder; however, most find that the film pales in comparison, with eye weekly calling it "just another pretentious jacob's ladder knockoff." the film has been described as stylish, with iofilm calling it "a triumph of style over content." shadows on the wall adds, "evans fills the screen with... moody, atmospheric, and evocative visuals," and filmcritic.com says the film has "the ring-inspired creepy imagery."neil young's film lounge describes the film's visual in this way: "evans (along with cinematographer john mathieson, production-designer richard smith and editor mags arnold) tries desperately to jazz everything up, deploying all manner of distorted visuals - extreme camera angles and close-ups, plus over-atmospheric lighting effects and jagged cuts - in a strenuous attempt to get us into ben's tormented state-of-mind."colin firth's performance is the most praised aspect of the film. "he delivers a performance which highlights the range of his considerable talent" cites one critic. efilmcritic says firth "does the best with what he's given" and iofilm says, "firth puts in a sterling performance in the central role." reel film reviews adds "firth's performance, not surprisingly, is the best thing about the movie, and the actor does a nice job of portraying ben's increasing paranoia."
