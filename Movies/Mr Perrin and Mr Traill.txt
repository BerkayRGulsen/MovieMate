the comfortable but lonely world of a middle-aged schoolmaster, "pompo" perrin, is upset when a new colleague arrives and proves popular with the boys, if impatient with petty school norms. the school, part of an isolated cliffside community in cornwall, is a minor private one run by a headmaster who is somewhat sadistic and threatening towards his staff. perrin's frustration deepens as traill, the younger man, who has seen action in the war and is more worldly and confident, begins a relationship with an attractive school nurse, with whom perrin has for some time been enamoured. perrin feels himself increasingly undermined and humiliated at work, and losing his connection to his pupils. he slides into resentment and depression. he develops fantasies of violence against his perceived enemy, leading to a tragic conclusion.
