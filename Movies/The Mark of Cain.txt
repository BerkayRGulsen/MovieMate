== critical reception ==
in reviewing the mark of cain, britmovie wrote, "... the story never catches fire, one reason for this is the heavy-handed direction of brian desmond hurst which fails to maintain adequate suspense. dermot walsh and patrick holt overplay their roles and both were a promise never really to be fulfilled, but eric portman dominates the film in a barnstorming acting performance. sally gray is somewhat inconsequential and theres no spark of chemistry between the leads."film critic allan essler smith wrote, "this powerful drama is an interesting example of a strand of late 1940s british cinema, but has been long neglected and not shown on british tv for many years, if at all. set in the late victorian and early edwardian eras, it has excellent period detail and the sets effectively highlight sarah's alienation and despair in the howards's suffocating and gloomy household."
