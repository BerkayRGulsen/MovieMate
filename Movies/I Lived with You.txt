== critical reception ==
tv guide wrote, "originally a play by novello, who transplanted almost the entire cast for the filmed version, the main exception to the stage cast being lupino, who gave a strong emotional performance."  and the radio times wrote, "it's all directed with a teasingly respectable salaciousness by maurice elvey, but of much greater interest to most film fans will be the pre-fame performances of jack hawkins and ida lupino."  and bbc wales arts wrote, "this is a riotously funny film and novello not for the first or last time on screen, operates, tantalisingly, on different layers. he's always aware of his screen spectator in the dark, but don't be misled - this performance doesn't reek of the greasepaint in the least. it's just that novello has the rare ability to maintain a playful, ironic stance which many critics, even today, seem incapable of appreciating or recognising."
