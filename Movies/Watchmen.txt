== reception ==
sify wrote "despite the crisp runtime, top technicalities and sincere effort from the actors, watchman fails to engage us and ends up as yet another wishy-washy film." times of india wrote "the plot offers great scope for a gripping action thriller. but the screenplay seems rushed and ends up as a half-baked attempt." the hindu wrote "thankfully, the vijay-directed watchman works to an extent, and has potential at the box-office, despite being stripped of regular commercial ingredients." film companion south wrote "only brief flashes in the second half make good on the premise, thanks to some inventive staging and the low-light cinematography by nirav shah and saravanan ramasamy...this broad benji-style cuteness is completely at odds with the claustrophobic panic room-style thriller the director is going for".
