== plot ==
in the deep jungles of darkest peru, a british geographer discovers a previously unknown species of bear. he is about to shoot it to take back a specimen to the united kingdom when a second bear playfully takes his gun away and saves his life by removing a deadly scorpion from his jacket. he learns that the bears are intelligent and can learn english, and that they have a deep appetite for marmalade, and names them lucy (after his mother) and pastuzo (after an exotic boxer he once met). as he departs, he throws his hat to pastuzo and tells the bears that they are always welcome if they wish to go to london.
forty years later, the two bears are living in harmony with their orphaned nephew, until an earthquake destroys their home, forcing them to seek shelter underground. uncle pastuzo fails to reach the shelter in time and is killed by a falling tree; his nephew finds his hat the next morning. aunt lucy encourages her nephew to go and find solace in london by stowing away on a cargo ship, while she moves into the home for retired bears.
the young bear arrives in london and eventually reaches paddington station, where he meets the brown family, who take him home temporarily and name him after the station they found him in. henry brown, the father and a devoted risk analyst, does not believe paddington's story, and is adamant that paddington stay only one night while they find a place for him to live permanently, but his wife mary, an illustrator, and their two children, jonathan and judy, find him endearing, as does mrs. bird, the housekeeper.
paddington thinks he can find a home with the explorer who found aunt lucy and uncle pastuzo, but does not know his name. since there seems to be no word of his expedition anywhere on the internet, mary takes paddington to samuel gruber, an antique shop owner who discovers that the hat bears the stamp of the geographers' guild, but the guild has no record of an expedition to peru. with the help of henry, paddington infiltrates the guild's archive and discovers an expedition to peru was undertaken by the explorer, whose name is montgomery clyde (although the guild erased their record of the expedition).
meanwhile, the hateful museum taxidermist millicent clyde captures, kills, and stuffs exotic animals to house in the natural history museum. when she becomes aware of paddington, she immediately sets out to hunt him down. the brown family departs for the day, leaving paddington home alone. scheming with the browns' nosy next-door neighbour, mr. curry, millicent sneaks in and attempts to capture paddington; he manages to defend himself, but inadvertently starts a fire in the kitchen in the process. paddington tries to tell the browns his story of millicent's kidnapping attempt, but no one believes him.
that night, paddington leaves and attempts to track down montgomery clyde himself, using the phone book to find the addresses of every "m. clyde" in london. he eventually finds millicent's house, and learns that montgomery clyde, who was millicent's father, died a long time ago. millicent resents her father for losing his membership of the guild after he refused to bring a peruvian bear specimen home, even though it would have made his family wealthy, and subsequently opened a petting zoo and his wife left him and run off with a magician. millicent is determined to succeed where her father failed, by stuffing paddington so she can become rich and famous herself. she tranquilizes paddington and prepares to stuff him, but when mr. curry discovers her true intentions, he informs the brown family and they rush to save paddington. they rescue him, and after reaching the roof, paddington subdues millicent by throwing a marmalade sandwich (which he keeps in his hat for emergencies) at her. this attracts a huge flock of pigeons, distracting her, before mrs. bird opens a roof hatch, pushing her off the roof and trapping her on a flagpole.
in the aftermath, the browns allow paddington to move in with their family. millicent is arrested and subsequently sentenced to community service at the petting zoo her father opened. paddington writes to aunt lucy, saying he is happy and has finally found a home. he is later seen enjoying a snowball fight with the browns, and throws one at the camera before the film ends.

character into the 21st century without sacrificing his essential charm, delivering a family-friendly adventure as irresistibly cuddly as its star." on metacritic, the film has a score of 77 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally favourable reviews". according to cinemascore, audiences gave the film a grade of "a" on an a+ to f scale.upon its uk release, peter bradshaw of the guardian gave the film four out of five stars, saying: "the new cgi-live-action paddington bear could easily have been another garish, cheapo brit-movie. instead, writer-director paul king ... and co-writer hamish mccoll have created a charming and sweet-natured family film, full of wit and fun, skewed towards young children but cheekily speckled with sly gags pitched at the older audience." geoffrey macnab of the independent called it a "film of considerable charm but one undermined by a very bitty and flimsy screenplay. writer-director paul king has more flair for comic set-pieces than he does for sustained narrative."indiewire said critics were "pleasantly surprised" and that the film was "hailed for its warm-heartedness and playful sense of humor ... and whishaw's charming performance". guy lodge of variety praised it for "honouring the everyday quirks of bond's stories, while subtly updating their middle-class london milieu". leslie felperin of the hollywood reporter gave the film a positive review, saying: "it's a relief to report that the final film is actually quite charming, thoughtful and as cuddly as a plush toy, albeit one with a few modern gizmos thrown in." ignatiy vishnevetsky of the a.v. club gave the film a b, saying: "if the film seems head-and-shoulders above the average effects-driven family-matinee flick, it's because it never gives the impression that it's trying to be anything more (or less) than good-natured and fun to watch." jason clark of entertainment weekly gave the film an a-, saying: "a gloriously whimsical big-screen debut that's closer to the madcap spirit of the muppets and the lovingly rendered style of a wes anderson film than to standard multiplex family fodder." claudia puig of usa today gave the film three out of four stars, saying: "paddington's journey from south america to london is just droll enough for adults  qualifying as a gentle parable about xenophobia  and exuberant enough for the youngest viewers." moira macdonald of the seattle times gave the film three out of five stars, saying: "paddington is, ultimately, about how a newcomer can become part of a family, and about how good manners and marmalade can get you out of any tricky situation  delightful messages, at any age." bruce demara of the toronto star gave the film three out of four stars, saying: "it's a relief to say that  as films based on fictional animals go  paddington is better than merely bearable."barbara vandenburgh of the arizona republic gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying: "paddington is a mostly smart update loaded with charm, and it preserves enough of the fuzzy feelings for purists to walk away with a smile." peter travers of rolling stone gave the film four out of five stars, saying: "an irresistible charmbomb. the in-jokes are verbal and visual, managing to reference themes as diverse as immigration and insider trading. it's all very droll and quietly, memorably dazzling." sandie angulo chen of the washington post gave the film three out of four stars, saying: "because of its adorable protagonist, laugh-out-loud gags and touching premise, paddington succeeds in a way most cgi/live-action hybrids do not." betsy sharkey of the los angeles times gave the film a positive review, saying: "artfully and cleverly, the sweet spirit of that young bear from darkest peru and his many london misadventures materializes brilliantly on screen in the very good hands of writer-director-conjurer paul king."mary houlihan of the chicago sun-times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying: "this is a charming film whose underlying message of tolerance and acceptance strikes a palpable chord in today's world  both for children and adults." jocelyn noveck of the associated press gave the film a positive review, saying: "for parents looking for a film that'll please them and their kids in equal measure, paddington isas goldilocks would say in that other bear storyjust right." tom long of the detroit news gave the film a b+, saying: "paddington is an absolute delight, visually inventive, thoroughly goofy and goosed by a mix of dry british wit and pratfall shenanigans."two years after the film's release, in 2016, empire magazine ranked paddington 81st on their list of the 100 best british films, with their entry stating, a great big hug of a movie, paddington charmed the public and critics alike in one of the nicest surprises of 2014, adding itself to the canon of beloved christmas movies.
