a painless solution doesn't exist in most cases. all said and done, the movie is worth a watch" and gave the rating "good". avinash gopinath of oneindia entertainment rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated "kaaviya thalaivan is a classic from vasanthabalan which is simply brilliant except for the song placement of 'yaarumilla' song which disturbs the pace of the movie. but that shouldn't stop anyone from witnessing kaaviya thalaivan's magic in theaters. watch out for the dialogue between siddharth and nassar before the interval and the conversation between siddharth and prithviraj in the climax which are the highlights of this extraordinary film."s. saraswati of rediff.com felt that the film is worth a watch, giving it a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and wrote "this is a role of a lifetime for siddharth, a truly memorable performance. he sports innumerable looks in the film and is perfect in every one of them, totally at ease with the character and the body language. equally adept are prithviraj, vedhika, nassar and thambi ramaiah. on the downside, the spotlight seems to be focused a little longer than necessary on siddharth, strengthening his character. prithviraj and vedhika are left holding the short end of the stick." behindwoods rated the film 3 out of 5 and stated "technically very sound, kaaviya thalaivan is marked by excellent performances and production values. balan has brought alive in front of us the stage, the makeup, the color and the myriad other things that go into a drama production of those days. credits are definitely due to vasanthabalan for his efforts to showcase the tradition of performing arts in a bygone era to the whatsapp generation. kaaviya thalaivan sure is a different viewing experience, give it your time and patience." at behindwoods, dilani rabindran wrote "kaaviyathalaivan deserves to be seen widely and appreciated internationally, not just because it is richly made  but because it is differently made, and the results are reverentially entertaining. it is truly sad that we dont see more ambitious films like this in south indian cinema, but perhaps that is what makes it such a gem. i highly suggest you do not miss seeing this rare commodity on the big screen."however, baradwaj rangan of the hindu remarked that the film had a great premise which doesn't fulfill its potential. he felt that siddharth and prithviraj struggled with ill-defined parts and extremely predictable events and after criticizing the film for the modernization of sequences and dialogues, selection of singers and lack of proper confrontation scenes between the protagonists, he concluded "there is no denying vasanthabalans desire to make good cinema, but like his other films, kaaviya thalaivan makes us give him an a for effort, even as we rummage down the alphabet when it comes to aspects of the execution." haricharan pudipeddi of ians stated "at the end of kaaviya thalaivan, there's a side in you that wants to laud the effort of auteur g. vasanthabalan, who has always strived to give us good cinema, especially for recreating a bygone era in grand style on screen. then, there's another side that will ask why all his films with great potential don't get their due treatment. you would salute the effort that has gone into its making, but never the final product" and rated the film 3 out of 5 and praised vasanthabalan for extracting good performances from the principal cast and the film's offbeat theme. however, he felt that the film had a heavy reference from mahabharata and compared the characters of nassar, prithviraj and siddharth with drona, arjuna and ekalavya respectively; though he felt that arjuna and ekalavya are pitted against each other in this film. cinemalead rated a 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, "a classic from vasantha balan!"
