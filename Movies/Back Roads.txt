=== development ===
in back roads, british actor alex pettyfer, (magic mike, elvis & nixon, the strange ones) makes his directorial debut, realizing a dream to direct and make the 1999 new york times bestselling novel by author tawni odell into a film. he also plays the lead character of harley, in a cast that includes jennifer morrison, nicola peltz, chiara aurelia, hala finley, june carryl, with robert patrick and juliette lewis.
the project has long compelled pettyfers interest. nearly a decade ago, when the film was originally announced as an adrian lyne production, the actor auditioned for the role of harley. unfortunately, it didnt work out, says pettyfer, who was 18 or 19 at the time. but pettyfer never lost hope for the movie. as his professional ambitions evolved, the possibility of making it a reality emerged with the formation of upturn productions, llc.
pettyfer and his producing partner craig robinson setup upturn productions in 2015 with the intent of securing literary works that could be made into film or television. their first project secured was based on the life of colombian drug lord, griselda blanco, which they developed with lbi entertainments julie yorn and patrick walmsley, and secured a co-production with jennifer lopez and her producing partner elaine goldsmith-thomas at nuyorican productions. the feature film project was picked up by hbo with terence winter attached to write and executive produce with jennifer lopez. upturn went on to secure its next co-production with producer michael ohoven (the human stain, the final cut, push, and capote), who had controlled the rights to back roads for over ten years. after numerous attempts to secure a top tier director for the film in 2016, with pettyfer as the lead, robinson went back to his financiers of the film and convinced them to give pettyfer an opportunity to direct back roads as his first film.
pettyfer and robinson hadnt taken on the project with the expectation of pettyfer directing, it was more to control the content upturn wanted to produce with pettyfer as a lead. i always approached it as an actor, he says. as an actor, its a rich piece of material. never in my right mind would i ever think that i would get the opportunity to direct a film, ever. so, really, me coming back to it, i knew it was an important piece of material to talk about, and we as actors are always looking for a challenge, so to me i was coming back to get the project made.
robinson secured pettyfers directorial foothold on several grounds. firstly, the financiers were willing to agree to the condition of reducing their risk and budget, which equated to a limited twenty-three day shooting schedule. secondly, they stipulated that pettyfer would be bolstered in his endeavor by a support network of upturn and infinitys team of professionals, including producer michael ohoven and writer/producer ashley mansour.


=== filming ===
working with cinematographer jarin blaschke (i believe in unicorns, the witch), pettyfer made use of locations in the southern louisiana town of st. francisville to stand in for a rural pennsylvania that feels like a closed-off shadow world. you dont know the era or where you are, pettyfer says. i kind of set it in the early 90s. only one clock is witnessed, and no cell phones. theres only a pay phone, and you begin feeling more and more closed in. in the beginning, there are opening shots of landscape, but then it becomes darker and more confined.
given the storys lurid undertow, pettyfer was mindful of overplaying the material, encouraging the films audience to key in on its psychological complexity and feel compassion for characters whose inner and outer lives have been twisted up by tragic circumstances dangerously larger than themselves.
the key behind the film i wanted to make was a much more subtle film and that was my take from the beginning, pettyfer says. i wanted it to be an exploration of emotion and an exploration of family drama, rather than an exploration into this kind of sexual dark romance. if adrian lyne had made the film, he would have made a completely different film. not necessarily better or worse, just a different film. i could have gone down that avenue but i wanted to create something different.
