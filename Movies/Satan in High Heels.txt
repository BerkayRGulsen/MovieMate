stacey wows them with her vocal ability and begins being groomed as a leading chanteuse at the night club.  arnold kenyon, the club's owner, falls in love with stacey and makes her his mistress, unaware that while he is lavishing her with expensive gifts and grooming her for a singing debut at his club, she is also having an affair with his playboy son, laurence.
on her opening night, stacey's estranged husband, rudy, arrives at the club. using both emotional and sexual appeal, stacey persuades him to kill arnold; but rudy bungles the murder attempt and confesses his intention to arnold.  her double-dealing nature out in the open, stacey is abandoned by all the men in her life, put out of her apartment, and left alone on the streets.
