== reception ==
in his the new york times review, mordaunt hall found that the "denouement is scarcely satisfactory, for it is not quite clear how mr. vance reaches his conclusions." also, in his opinion, "mr. william, while he does fair work, is not as easy and smooth in the rle as was  mr. [william] powell."
