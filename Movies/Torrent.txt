mgm was uncertain about how to cast garbo after her arrival in hollywood. in torrent,  her first american film, she was cast as leonora, a spanish peasant girl, and mgm was pleased with the results.
variety reviewed the film and described garbo in her debut as " a girl with everything, looks, acting ability and personality". the film grossed $668,000 worldwide, netting a $126,000 profit for mgm. louis b. mayer's initial instinct about the actress's ability paid off, and the film was a success. the torrent was released on dvd in 2011 as part of the warner archive collection.
