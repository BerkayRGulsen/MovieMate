== plot ==
in 1995 detroit, jimmy "b-rabbit" smith jr. (eminem) is a young, unhappy blue-collar worker from a poor family. jimmy has moved back north of 8 mile road to the run-down trailer home in warren, michigan, of his alcoholic mother stephanie (kim basinger), his younger sister lily (chloe greenfield), and stephanie's abusive live-in boyfriend greg (michael shannon). although encouraged by his friends, jimmy worries about his potential as a rapper. one night, jimmy freezes during a rap battle at a local venue, the shelter, and he leaves the stage humiliated.
during the day, jimmy works at a car factory. desperate for money, he asks for extra shifts, but his supervisor bluntly dismisses his request because of his habitual tardiness. later on, jimmy befriends a woman named alex (brittany murphy), and he begins to take more responsibility for the direction of his life. 
at some point, stephanie receives an eviction notice, as she cannot pay rent. despite her best attempts to keep the eviction notice a secret, greg finds out about it and confronts stephanie. when jimmy attacks greg for threatening his mother, they fight, and greg leaves stephanie for good.
jimmy's friendship with wink (eugene byrd), a radio dj with ties to a record label promoter, becomes strained after he discovers that wink does promotional work for jimmy's rivals, a rap group known as the "leaders of the free world". at one point, jimmy and his friends get into a violent brawl with the free world crew, which is disrupted when jimmy's friend cheddar bob (evan jones) pulls out a gun and accidentally shoots himself in the leg; he survives after being rushed to the hospital.
during a lunch break at work, one of jimmy's coworkers (xzibit) performs a freestyle rap insulting a gay co-worker, paul (craig chandler). jimmy raps a freestyle defending paul. alex arrives and is impressed by jimmy's actions and they have sex. wink arranges for jimmy to meet with producers at a recording studio, but jimmy finds wink and alex having sex. enraged, jimmy attacks wink as alex tries to break up their altercation.
in retaliation, wink and the leaders of the free world assault jimmy outside his trailer. the leader of the gang, papa doc, holds jimmy at gunpoint and threatens to kill him, but wink dissuades him. after the group has left jimmy alone, his mother arrives with enough money to pay to avoid eviction, having won $3,200 at a bingo tournament.
jimmy's best friend and battle host, future (mekhi phifer), pushes him to get revenge by competing against the leaders of the free world at the next rap battle. jimmy agrees, but his boss, having noticed improved effort at work, agrees to give jimmy some late-night shifts that conflict with the next battle. a goodbye visit from alex, who is moving to new york, changes his mind about competing, and paul agrees to cover the start of his shift as a favor while jimmy goes to the battle.
in all rounds of the rap battle, jimmy has to compete against one member of the free world crew. after winning the first two rounds against lyckety-splyt and lotto, he faces off against papa doc and ultimately wins by preemptively pointing out his own "white trash" roots and difficult life and then exposing that papa doc, despite posing as a thug, has comparatively privileged and stable upbringing. with nothing to say in rebuttal, papa doc hands the microphone back to future, embarrassed. after being congratulated by alex and his friends, jimmy is offered a position by future co-hosting battles at the shelter. jimmy declines, saying he has to go his own way, and walks back to work.
