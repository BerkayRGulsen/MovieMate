== reception ==
taran adarsh, writing for bollywood hungama, was critical of the movie. while he lauded the chase scenes and found the film's one song "foot-tapping", he felt the constant moving of the camera got irritating and concluded the screenplay, which he described as "hackneyed", "uninteresting" and "inconsistent", ruined what might have otherwise been an interesting film.
