it's a very religious film. because of that, it is not very commercial, is not very successful. i think it's a very good film... exile is about the sea. it's also about society, how it always destroys the individual: that we're not the end product of that society, we're just there to be manipulated and used. it's about a man kicked out of society who really becomes himself. he shines, burns through all the rubbish of the mind and the body. he has to somehow survive physically as well, and he does it quite brilliantly. people even get jealous of him. they ban him and exile him.
