=== critical response ===
diego semerene of slant magazine gave the film 0.5 stars out of 4, writing, "the film is an unquestionably pornographic fantasy barely trying to pass as something other than masturbation material." he added, "below her mouth's stiff acting and dialogue suggest a misguided blue is the warmest color influence reduced to the sexy aesthetics of lesbian sex but completely oblivious to that which actually animates the film's impossibly beautiful, unbearably smooth, and perpetually horny bodies." guy lodge of variety described it as "a sexually frank but narratively flimsy girl-meets-girl romance that never gets under its gorgeous characters' amply exposed skin." frank scheck of the hollywood reporter called it "an undeniably steamy effort that delivers plenty of heat in its sex scenes, while falling significantly short in dramatic terms." katie walsh of the los angeles times said: "despite the female filmmakers at the helm, the film treads into exploitative territory, with the ratio of screen time given to writhing female bodies far outweighing that given to their unique experiences as gay or closeted women in the world." jude dry of indiewire wrote: "what, exactly, is below her mouth? her chin? her body? her entire mind and spirit? it's a fittingly ambiguous title for a directionless film, late night fare that will be enjoyed by just as many horny men as horny teenage lesbians."
