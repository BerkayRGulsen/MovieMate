"it ain't over 'til it's over" is a song recorded, written, and produced by american musician lenny kravitz for his second studio album, mama said (1991). released as the album's second single in june 1991, the song is a mid-tempo ballad, musically inspired by motown, philly soul, and earth, wind & fire (particularly "that's the way of the world"). the horn line at the end is performed by the phenix horns from earth, wind & fire. "that song just came out one day, and i knew it had a classic vibe. and i still love that song very much today," kravitz said in an interview for vivamusic.com in 2000. the line is based on a yogiism, or quotation from yogi berra: "it ain't over 'til it's over." it was kravitz's first top 10 hit on the billboard hot 100 of his career, and his highest peak in the chart. british singer mutya buena's 2007 song "real girl" contains a sample from "it ain't over 'til it's over".


== background ==
the song was written by kravitz while dealing with a struggling marriage to his then wife, lisa bonet, and was an attempt to rekindle the relationship. kravitz has described his thinking at that time as "not just a depression, but a fog. i didnt know which way was up".initially kravitz, realizing the hit potential of the song, did not want to release the song himself, wishing to remain an underground artist, thinking instead of giving the song to smokey robinson. his label however eventually persuaded him to include it on the album.


== critical reception ==
christopher a. daniel from albumism said that the song "marries his curtis mayfield-inspired falsetto with chunky stax records guitars and a lush mfsb-flavored (possibly love unlimited orchestra) string arrangement." stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic noted its "swirling philly soul", describing the song as "instantly addictive". carla hay of axs stated, "kravitz has said he wrote this song about the breakdown of his marriage to actress lisa bonet (they eventually divorced), and the heartbreak is oozing all over this song." she added, "with a motown-ish 1960s vibe, this ballad (from 1991s mama said album) is one of kravitzs best ballads. it remains his highest-charting hit of his career in the u.s., where it peaked at no. 2 on the billboard hot 100 chart." larry flick from billboard called it a "delicious slice of philly soul/pop, flavored with lush strings, understated funk bass and guitar riffs, and kravitz's engaging falsetto vocal. could be a sleeper smash." alex henderson from cashbox picked the song as one of the "goodies" from the album, describing it as ""uptown soul"-flavoured". music & media commented that the singer "sings in smooth tones, reminiscent of curtis mayfield and the style council. soultime on ehr." also sunday tribune noted that paul weller and mayfield are "echoed" in the song.
