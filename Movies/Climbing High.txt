== reception ==
writing for allmovie bruce eder considered climbing high to be one of jessie matthews best vehicles which he noted was: " a surprising result considering it is devoid of the musical numbers that one would have expected from one of england's top dancing and singing talents of the period. what it has is a brilliantly piercing witty script ... superbly engaging acting performances by all concerned and superb pacing." eder further noted that " carol reed was only 3 years into his career ... and was already one of the top comedy directors in england." he concluded that climbing high was " one of the most entertaining british comedies of the period with some piercing topical humour (especially about the advertising business and political activism) that still holds today."
