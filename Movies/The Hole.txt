== critical response ==
david cornelius of dvd talk found the film somewhat limited in scope, saying, "the limitations placed upon the story prevent any broadening of ideas, leaving us only with a clichd chunk of domestic thriller that plays out by the numbers". however, he also acknowledged that such limitations also helped the film in other areas, saying, "the hole becomes very claustrophobic, with a tension that never lets up for the last forty-some minutes. it's grandiose and outrageous, yes, but it's also highly effective in building the right kind of scares".
