john milton escapes hell and steals satan's gun, the godkiller, to kill jonah king. king, a cult leader who killed milton's daughter and her husband, plans to sacrifice milton's infant granddaughter, believing it will unleash hell on earth.
after interrogating and murdering some of king's followers in colorado, milton discovers that the ritual will take place in stillwater, an abandoned prison in louisiana. on his way there he stops by a diner, where he meets piper, a waitress. milton abandons his damaged car and sabotages piper's car, a 1969 dodge charger, offering to fix it in exchange for a ride.
piper walks in on her boyfriend, frank, cheating on her. piper beats the woman and assaults frank, who knocks piper unconscious. milton hears the commotion and comes to piper's aid. milton steals frank's car and takes piper with him to stillwater. a supernatural operative of satan, the accountant, arrives on earth with the mission to retrieve milton and the gun. the accountant interrogates frank and discovers milton's destination. after murdering frank, he tricks a pair of state troopers into helping him.
at a shady hotel, milton, while having sex with a waitress from a nearby bar, is attacked by king and his men, but he kills most of them. the accountant appears with the police and chases after milton and piper, who are chasing after king's van. milton uses the godkiller to shoot at the accountant, causing him to drive off a bridge. they follow king to a church, only to find it filled with king's followers. they are ambushed and captured. they kidnap piper and leave milton for dead, but he awakens, kills king's men, and pursues the rv. piper breaks free, fights king, and jumps out of the rv onto milton's car. king disables the car by shooting its engine.
milton and piper meet milton's friend webster, who gives them a 1971 red chevrolet chevelle ss. piper discovers that milton is undead and had to abandon his daughter to protect her from his former companions, which allowed king to manipulate her into joining his cult. webster reveals that milton died 10 years prior in a shootout and that webster personally carried his coffin. she also discovers that the godkiller has the power to completely destroy one's soul, preventing it from going to either heaven or hell. meanwhile, one of king's surviving men tells the accountant why milton is chasing them.
after arming himself, milton tells piper and webster to leave, concerned for their safety, but piper says she has never before had a worthy cause to fight for and is with him regardless of the consequences. with the help of the now-intrigued accountant, they evade the troops of sheriff cap and arrive at stillwater. the accountant captures piper and forces milton to give up the godkiller before he can engage king, but he allows milton to attempt to save his granddaughter, noting that satan is the warden of a very large prison and despises the sacrifice of innocent lives in his name.
while milton slaughters king's men before they can sacrifice the child, piper escapes the accountant with the godkiller. king eventually gets the upper hand on milton and savagely beats him. piper fires the godkiller at king, but misses and knocks herself out. king is enraged when another follower refuses to murder the infant. the accountant attracts king's attention, allowing milton to grab the godkiller and shoot king.
the accountant retrieves the baby and allows milton to say goodbye to her. milton gives her to piper, who promises to care for her. webster arrives and looks on as milton "dies". after both piper and webster have left, milton is revealed to still not be fully dead. milton makes good on his earlier promise to webster and drinks a beer from the remains of king's skull. he agrees to return to hell but threatens to escape again if he is punished too severely. the accountant claims that he looks forward to it, and the two drive a 1957 chevrolet bel air into the gates of hell.

== production ==
cage stated that he was originally drawn to the project by a scene in which his character's eyes get shot out. in his previous film, season of the witch, he had wanted to have such a scene but producers rejected the idea.the film was shot in 3d, and special effects were created by gary tunnicliffe. the cameras were rented from paradise fx. one reason cage chose this film was to be part of the new 3d technology.the three cars driven by cage in the film are a 1964 buick riviera, a 1969 dodge charger r/t (440 engine) and a 1971 chevrolet chevelle ss 454. writer/director patrick lussier said the riviera, used at the beginning and the end, "was the car we wished we had used the most, because it was a beautiful driving car", but "it was a shame to smack it up." three chargers and three chevelles were used, with one made very safe for the stunts, and one intended to be shown close to being destroyed.cage narrated the supernatural film at wondercon 2010. patrick lussier wrote the film with todd farmer. lussier filmed the movie in minden, plain dealing and shreveport, louisiana.
