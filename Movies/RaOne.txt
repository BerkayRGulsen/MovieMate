ra.one is a 2011 indian hindi-language superhero film directed by anubhav sinha and starring shah rukh khan, armaan verma, kareena kapoor, arjun rampal, shahana goswami and tom wu in pivotal roles. the script, written by anubhav sinha and kanika dhillon, originated as an idea that anubhav sinha got when he saw a television commercial and which he subsequently expanded. the film follows shekhar subramanium (shah rukh khan), a game designer who creates a motion sensor-based game in which the antagonist (ra.one) is more powerful than the protagonist (g.one). the former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill lucifer, the game id of shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged ra.one's power. relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out g.one from the virtual world to defeat ra.one and protect them.
principal photography began in march 2010 and took place in india and the united kingdom and was overseen by an international crew. the post-production involved 3-d conversion and the application of visual effects, the latter being recognised as a technological breakthrough among indian films. with a budget of 150 crore (equivalent to 249 crore or us$35 million in 2019), inclusive of publicity costs, ra.one was the most expensive indian film at the time of release surpassing the 132 crore (equivalent to 238 crore or us$33 million in 2019) budget of enthiran. the producers spent 130 crore (equivalent to 216 crore or us$30 million in 2019) out of a 52 crore (equivalent to 86 crore or us$12 million in 2019) marketing budget, which involved a nine-month publicity campaign, brand tie-ups, merchandise, video games and viral marketing.
the film faced controversies involving plagiarism, content leaks and copyright challenges. consequently, ra.one was theatrically released on 26 october 2011, the beginning of the five-day diwali weekend, in 2d, 3d and dubbed versions in tamil and telugu languages, with three international premieres being held between 24 & 26 october 2011. the film witnessed the largest international theatrical release for an indian film as of 2011 and was preceded by the high audience and commercial expectations.

== plot ==
jenny nayar (shahana goswami), an employee of uk-based company barron industries, introduces a new technology that allows objects from the digital world to enter the real world using the wireless transmissions from multiple devices. shekhar subramanium (shahrukh khan), who also works for the company, is given a final chance to devise with a video game with a difference. in order to impress his skeptical son prateek (armaan verma), and upon the request of his wife sonia (kareena kapoor), subramanium uses his sons idea that the antagonist be more powerful than the protagonist.
shekhar's colleague akashi (tom wu) provides the moves of the game's characters, jenny does the programming and shekhar gives his face to the game's protagonist g.one, whilst the antagonist ra.one is faceless and has substantially greater powers than those granted to g.one. the game has three levels, and either of the players can only be killed in the third level using a special gun that holds a single bullet. while designing the game, akashi notices some malfunctions but ignores them. when the game is finally launched, it receives a standing ovation and prateek loves it so much that he insists on playing it instantly. he logs in under the alias 'lucifer' and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by akashi. ra.one, being unable to end his turn with lucifer, becomes determined that lucifer shall die.
when the mainframe fails to shut down, akashi calls shekhar, who notices a problem with the game. ra.one uses the new technology to enter the real world and breaks free and goes to find lucifer.
ra one first threatens akashi and asks him where lucifer is. when akashi fails to reply, ra one thinks that he is useless and abruptly abducts and wastes akashi by knocking him off a large glass window that frightens shekhar and mercilessly plummets and murders an innocent akashi.
shekhar comes back to find a dead akashi bleeding and horribly hanging on live electric wires and ra one recharging. shekhar rushes home but is blocked by ra.one on the way. in an attempt to save his son, shekhar claims that he is lucifer. however, ra.one scans shekhar's i.d. and kills him for lying. prateek notices the strange circumstances of his fathers death and realises that ra.one has come to life. he and jenny attempt to bring g.one to life. meanwhile, sonia tells prateek that the family will return to india. having taken the form of akashi, ra.one chases them, but g.one enters the real world through jenny's computer and causes a gas explosion which saves them and temporarily destroys ra.one. g.one takes ra.one's h.a.r.t., without which ra.one is not powerful. sonia finds she cannot leave g.one and takes him along with them to india through shekhars passport. g.one promises sonia that he will protect prateek from any harm. ra.one returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model (arjun rampal), and tracks g.one and prateek.
during prateek's birthday party, ra.one hypnotises sonia, assumes her form and kidnaps prateek. ra.one then instructs g.one to give him his h.a.r.t. back, and sends the real sonia in an uncontrollable mumbai suburban railway train. g.one saves sonia just in the nick of time (though the chatrapati shivaji terminus is destroyed) and returns to save prateek. the game resumes, with prateek controlling g.one's moves. following a lengthy fight, both of the characters reach the third level. with little power left, g.one and prateek trick ra.one into shooting g.one without his h.a.r.t. attached, which leaves ra.one helpless. furious, ra.one creates ten copies of himself. prateek, unable to differentiate the real ra.one, asks g.one to quote one of shekhars sayings: "if you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you". the pair then realise that only one of the ten ra.ones has a shadow: the original one. g.one shoots and destroys him, and after absorbing ra.one's remains, transports himself back into the digital world.
several months later, prateek and sonia return to the uk, where prateek finally manages to restore g.one to the real world, much to his and his mother's joy.

== production ==


=== casting ===
khan was the first actor to be cast in the film. three actors had initially been considered for the lead female role; kapoor was ultimately chosen because she insisted on playing the part. rampal accepted the role of ra.one after sinha expressed a strong desire to cast him in the film. wu was contracted to the film in july 2010, and goswami was cast one month later. bachchan agreed to be a part of the film after being requested by khan and sinha. several cast members prepared extensively for their roles; rampal and kapoor followed special diets to lose weight, and verma learnt capoeira. khan and verma performed their own stunts, and kapoor subsequently did so as well despite initial reluctance.the cast encountered problems during production, khan faced difficulties with his superhero suit and prosthetic makeup, and injured his left knee. the decision to cast rampal was met with scepticism due to "questionable acting abilities," a statement sinha criticised. in addition, rampal encountered back problems (which were treated by the time production began), prompting speculation of a possible replacement by vivek oberoi. jackie chan had initially been approached for the role of aakaashi, but he declined the offer. rajnikanth suffered from health problems which caused a delay in the filming of his cameo appearance. dutt faced a scheduling conflict with agneepath (2012), which was later resolved.


=== development ===

according to director anubhav sinha, the idea of ra.one originated when he saw an advertisement on television which showed children remotely controlling a human. he was attracted to the concept and wrote a script based on it. sinha then approached khan, who liked the story and decided to produce the film under his production company red chillies entertainment. sinha wasn't sure about retaining khan's support after the former's previous film cash (2007) became a commercial failure, but khan reportedly "remained unchanged".shahrukh khan felt that the film possessed significant commercial potential, in addition to being a fulfilment of his "childhood dream" to be a superhero and to fly. he stated that he wanted to "make a film that gives me the right to deserve the iconic status that i've got for 20 years." he also said that he wanted to make a film dedicated to father-son relationships, which were, in his opinion, "neglected" in bollywood. khan's idea was to make a simple family drama which expanded into an action film. he declined to make the film in english to increase its appeal for western audiences, feeling that "cracking hollywood on their terms" was unnecessary. both khan and sinha credited their children for providing encouragement, and regularly "approving" the film's execution.red chillies entertainment continued to work on other projects before finalising the production aspects of ra.one. after providing the visual effects for my name is khan (2010), the studio focused solely on ra.one and did not take up any other films. khan initially approached a number of directors to helm the film, including aditya chopra and karan johar, but they declined; eventually, sinha was made the film's director. to prepare the film's premises and characterisation, sinha spent several months viewing video clips, digital art portals and comic books. sinha and khan also watched around 200 superhero films from all over the world. the storyboards were designed by atul chouthmal, who was contracted after he met khan at yash raj studios. while the former began work on the storyboards, the producers hired a storyboard artist from hollywood. chouthmal revealed that khan and the other artist differed on their visions of the film, and so he was brought back. before filming, khan reportedly took tips from actor kamal hassan regarding the production of large-scale films, having been impressed by hassan's dasavathaaram (2008).

the title of the film received significant media attention due to it being the name of the antagonist rather than the protagonist. the move was considered innovative, and noted as a sign of the "rising importance of the villain in bollywood." according to sinha, the title had not been planned as such, and was ultimately chosen because ra.one "sounded cooler" than g.one. khan was advised to name the film after his own character; he declined to do so, citing the inter-dependence between good and evil. he also called alfred hitchcock as his inspiration, and pointed out that the antagonists in films like sholay, mr. india and sadak were better remembered than the protagonists.


=== principal photography ===
the crew of ra.one featured both indian and overseas personnel. nicola pecorini served as the director of photography, with v. manikandan providing assistance. andy gill and spiro razatos were hired as the stunt supervisors, and nino pansini was hired as the stunt cinematographer. sabu cyril and marcus wookey were responsible for the production design. the film's producer was bobby chawla, but gauri khan later stepped in after the former suffered a brain haemorrhage. filming took place at a number of studios, notably filmistan studios, film city and yash raj studios in india and the black hangar studios in the uk.principal photography was initially set to begin in miami, but the idea was abandoned due to budget constraints. the first phase of filming began in goa on 21 march 2010 and continued until may. the second and third phases took place in london with the entire cast, beginning in july 2010 and ending in august. the next phase was split into two schedules; the first schedule commenced at filmistan studios in the first week of september 2010, while the second schedule began in december 2010 and took place over a seven-day period. the remaining portions were filmed in july 2011 at film city. a cameo appearance and a music video were filmed in the weeks leading up to the release, the former at the whistling woods studios in mumbai.ra.one featured three major action sequences, which were filmed in sets and real locations across mumbai and london. the cinematography borrowed ideas from video games, such as rapid transitions between first-person and third-person perspectives. procedures such as bullet time were also incorporated into the film. the production design was closely associated with the lighting and cinematography to facilitate smooth filming. however, filming faced a number of difficulties including increasing costs, delays and safety constraints. in addition, differences between khan and sinha caused tensions on the sets.


=== post-production ===
as with the filming crew, the post-production crew of the film included both indian and overseas personnel. prime focus carried out the film's 3-d conversion, with london-based colorist richard fearon performing the color grading. red chillies vfx partnered with a number of visual effects studios around the world, and undertook the incorporation of the visual effects under the supervision of jeffrey kleiser. nvidia provided the information technologybased software utilised for the effects, while edwark quirk supervised over the computer-generated imagery used in the film. resul pookutty was responsible for the film's sound design.

the idea for converting the film to 3-d was put forth during filming, and was implemented in july 2011 due to a revived interest in 3-d films. the process required 2,600 artists to convert 4,400 shots of the film. the sound design involved bridging the real and the virtual world, and the required sound enhancements were achieved by using the dolby surround 7.1 system. incorporating the visual effects began in april 2010, and was preceded by extensive research. 1,200 artists worked for 2 years to complete the visual effects work. a number of complex procedures were executed, including cubical transformations and the design of the faceless form of ra.one.despite precautions, the post-production faced significant delays owing to the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-d and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in the completion of the visual effects. the post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of cgi according to the cinematographer. the delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.


=== costumes ===

the bodysuits worn by khan and rampal were designed by robert kurtzman and tim flattery, and made by a team of specialists based in los angeles. sinha spent around three months conceptualizing the costumes, watching various superhero films to design a costume not created already. he then wrote a 23-page document with his sketches and details of what he wanted and gave it to the designers to work upon. to create the suit, khan was required to enter a small chamber where a warm latex-like liquid was released up to his neck and allowed to solidify, forming the mould which was then peeled off his body. the suit was joined by a concealed zipper and subsequently modified. computer-generated embellishments such as light beams and electricity were added to the suits after khan expressed dissatisfaction with the initial rushes of the film. a total of 21 costumes were made for the film, with each suit reportedly costing 10 million (us$140,000).khan's suit was made of reinforced latex, coloured steel-blue and fitted with micro-computer circuitry. rampal's suit was made of three-inch thick solid rubber, and was red in color. both actors were required to wear additional suits inside their body suits to prevent skin contact. wearing the suits created a number of difficulties for the actors. it took 20 minutes to put on the suits and 40 minutes to remove them. in addition, the non-porous nature of the suits created intense heat inside, causing excessive perspiration despite the presence of special air conditioning ducts. khan later felt that the suits' conception had been a mistake since filming occurred during the day; digital adjustments to the suits brought "all the efforts to naught."manish malhotra designed the look and the costume of kareena kapoor for the song "chammak challo", which received widespread media coverage. kapoor wore a red sari draped in the style of a dhoti. since the release of the song, the costume was termed a "fashion rage," becoming popular in india and some overseas countries. fashion experts applauded the costume and kapoor's ability to carry it off "stunningly," though certain experts dismissed the naming of the sari color.


== music ==

the soundtrack of ra.one was composed by vishal-shekhar, with the lyrics being written by atahar panchi, vishal dadlani and kumaar. a. r. rahman provided the background score for a single sequence. sinha announced that r&b singer akon and the prague philharmonic orchestra would be a part of the soundtrack; the former lent his vocals for "chammak challo" and "criminal", while the latter performed in "bhare naina". the composers obtained the official license to use ben e. king's "stand by me," on which they based the song "dildaara." the soundtrack contains fifteen tracks, including seven original songs, four remixes, three instrumentals and an international version of "chammak challo". the music rights were bought by t-series for 150 million (us$2.1 million). the hindi version of the soundtrack was released on 21 september 2011; the tamil version was released on 5 october 2011 and telugu version was released on 9 october 2011 respectively, featuring six tracks each.

=== marketing ===

the producers of ra.one spent 100 million (us$1.4 million) out of a 520 million (us$7.3 million) marketing budget, 150 million (us$2.1 million) of this was utilised for internet promotions alone. the film's first theatrical poster was released in december 2010, and was followed by the release of two teaser trailers during the 2011 icc cricket world cup. the first theatrical trailer premiered three months later. khan and sinha undertook a multi-city tour during which they unveiled a 3,600 feet-long piece of fan mail to collect audience messages. the official website of ra.one was launched on 31 may 2011, and an official youtube channel for the film was subsequently unveiled. on 20 october 2011, khan held a live chat with fans on google plus, the first time an indian film personality had done so. rampal's look in the film, which had been kept secret, was revealed in late october 2011.the film's marketing utilised merchandise and games to facilitate the creation of a franchise. khan marketed merchandise related to the film, which included toys, tablets and apparel. on 14 october 2011, a gaming tournament featuring games like call of duty was conducted in mumbai and telecast live on youtube. red chillies entertainment partnered with sony computer entertainment europe to create "ra.one  the game," a game for playstations which was released on 5 october 2011. the producers further collaborated with utv indiagames to design a social game titled ra.one genesis, with an independent plot based on g.one, in addition to designing digital comics based on the film's characters.


=== screenings ===
in may 2011, the first rushes of ra.one were shown to the cast of khan's other home production always kabhi kabhi (2011). subsequently, the film was screened for test audiences to study and gauge the film's appeal across different age groups. a few days prior to the theatrical release, khan arranged a special screening of the film's final cut in yash raj studios, where he invited close friends, his family and the film's crew. between 24 and 26 october 2011, ra.one had international premieres in dubai, london and toronto, all of which were chosen due to their international significance and large south asian populations. the premiere in dubai was held on 24 october 2011 at the grand cinemas, wafi. a high-profile dinner and charity auction followed, where khan raised aed30,000 (approximately us$8,200) to build a workshop for children with special needs. the premiere included three simultaneous screenings of the film, for which tickets were placed on sale for the public. the premiere in london took place at the o2 cineworld the following day, and the premiere in toronto took place at the tiff bell lightbox on 26 october 2011.ra.one was submitted to the central board of film certification on 14 october 2011 to receive its viewership rating. the board raised strong objections to the film's action scenes, fearing that they would influence young children to emulate the stunts. the police and the indian railways security force had made similar objections to the train-based stunts in the film, claiming that youngsters would "blindly imitate them" and hence put their lives at risk. the film was finally passed with a 'u' certificate without cuts, but under the condition that prominent disclaimers were shown, stating that the stunts were computer-generated and should not be imitated. the british board of film classification rated the film 12a for "moderate fantasy violence". in march 2012, a mid-day report alleged that ra.one had received a favourable rating, pointing out that the producers had violated the rules by meeting the board officials during the screening.


=== plagiarism allegations ===
the film faced allegations of plagiarism with similarities to terminator 2: judgment day (1991), the batman series, iron man (2008), the sorcerer's apprentice (2010) and tron: legacy (2010). khan denied the allegations, saying, "i got inspired from a lot of superhero movies but the movie is original. in fact, ra.one will be the first superhero-based movie in the world in which the superhero lives in a family."a few days before the release, screenwriter yash patnaik claimed that ra.one resembled a concept that he had developed several years before. patnaik appealed to the bombay high court to delay the film's release, until he was given due credit or 10% of the film's overall profit. the court, observing prima facie evidence that there had been copyright violations, asked the filmmakers to deposit 10 million (us$140,000) with the court on 21 october 2011 before releasing the film. patnaik challenged the court's decision and demanded that the producers give him credit and not cash. sinha later claimed that he alone had developed the film's story.


=== hacking ===
ra.one also faced cybertheft and hacking issues. on 3 june 2011, three days after its launch, the official website of the film was hacked by suspected pakistani cyber criminals who stated that the act was in revenge for a similar attack on a karachi press club website. the hackers defaced the homepage and left a note threatening the indian press club. despite precautions, the song "chammak challo" was leaked several months before the official release of the soundtrack. khan clarified that the leaked song was a "rough version" of the actual song, and that the person responsible for the leak was being looked for. he subsequently refuted claims that the leak had been engineered as a publicity stunt.


=== television and home media ===
the television broadcasting rights for ra.one were bought by star india for a then-record sum of 350 million, surpassing 3 idiots (2009). the indian television premiere of ra.one took place on 21 january 2012 on star gold, garnering a 28% market sharefor the channel and a tvr of 6.7. star india subsequently syndicated the television screening rights to disney xd, where it premiered on 2 june 2012. in may 2012, international media distribution announced that ra.one would be televised on comcast and cox, as a part of the celebrations of the asian pacific american heritage month. discovery channel tied up with red chillies entertainment to produce a one-hour program titled "revealed: the making of ra.one," which aired on the channel on 30 march 2012. the program discussed the making of the film in detail, including the visual effects and the challenges faced while filming.eros international released the dvd of ra.one on 13 december 2011 across all regions in one-disc and two-disc packs complying with the ntsc format. the dvd of the film contained alternate endings. initially, khan had wanted to add alternate endings to the theatrical release itself, but later deemed it risky. the dvd version was made interactive as well. vcd and blu-ray versions of the film were also released.the german blu-ray edition was released on 1 june 2012 by rapid eye movies. on 24 july 2013, french distributor condor released the film as voltage on 3d blu-ray. it was released in a steelbook edition containing the 3d/2d blu-ray discs and the dvd. the same year, japanese distributor maxam released the blu-ray on 27 september 2013.

== economics ==


=== pre-release ===
the budget of ra.one was the subject of significant speculation prior to its release. a number of estimates placed the budget between 1.4 billion (us$20 million) and 2.0 billion (us$28 million). it was universally accepted that the film was the most expensive bollywood film of all time, with certain sources stating that the film was the most expensive indian film ever. the original budget was revealed to be 1.30 billion (us$18 million) after promotional expenses. khan stated that he had "worked very hard" to finance the film without borrowing money, and reportedly hosted a television show just to finance the film. ra.one earned 1.32 billion (us$19 million) from pre-release revenue sources, setting a new record for bollywood films.the extensive marketing campaign greatly increased audience expectations of the film. ra.one set records for the level of pre-release buzz for a bollywood film, and also topped a number of polls gauging the most awaited bollywood films of the year. anticipation for the film was equally high among the trade analysts, with some commenting that the film would pass the 1 billion (us$14 million) mark in one week and the 3 billion (us$42 million) mark in over three weeks. advance bookings commenced on 20 october 2011 on a limited scale, and expanded later. while initial ticket sales were low, they picked up considerably near the release date. a few days prior to the release, the advance booking was described as "phenomenal," with an overall advance booking rate of 2025% across the country. a number of advantages of the film's release were pointed out, such as the festive season and higher 3d ticket prices, though there had been doubt regarding the timely release of the 3d version.


=== box office ===
in india, ra.one debuted at the beginning of the five-day diwali weekend, and subsequently broke the diwali opening day record. the film then set the records for the biggest single-day net revenue and the biggest three-day opening weekend earned by a bollywood film, breaking the previous records held by bodyguard.subsequently, the film began to suffer significant drops in its collections, with its five-day extended weekend and nine-day extended week coming second to the records of bodyguard. the film faced an 84 percent drop in collections in its second week and fell a further 90 percent in its third week, the latter primarily due to the release of rockstar. the dubbed versions showed similar trends. the tamil and telugu versions together earned around 50 million nett.in overseas markets, ra.one earned the highest three-day and five-day opening weekends among the bollywood releases of 2011; by its second weekend, the film had become the highest-grossing bollywood film of 2011 in overseas markets, but the collections suffered drops throughout. in general, families and children formed the major portion of the film's audience, and the 3d version is regarded as a success.
