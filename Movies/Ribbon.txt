=== critical response ===
pallabi dey purkayastha of the times of india gave the film a rating of 3 star out of 5 and said that, "all in all, ribbon starts off with one storyline and ends with another, but fails to capture the gamut of both. rakhee sandilya has started a conversation on a less-spoken human emotion, very humanely. if only she had taken one route and explored it to its optimum level."  kriti tulsiani of news 18 gave the film a rating of 3 stars out of 5 saying that, "at a time when bollywood is journeying away from the usual potboilers, a film like ribbon is more than welcome. it addresses subjects that bollywood and even parents sometimes shy away from addressing to their children. so even if the film is a little bland and a little uneven per se, ribbon makes for a better watch than most of the no-brainers today." sweta kausal of hindustan times gave the film a rating of 2.5 stars out of 5 and said that "ribbon rakes up a lot of issues that deserve at least a discourse in the current scenario, but instead, ends up only fleetingly touching these. neither the characters nor the narrative take upon the evils and the evil-doers."  shubhra gupta of the indian express gave the film a rating of 2.5 stars out of 5 and said that, "koechlin leaves a mark as a harried professional, reluctant mom, and a good wife. vyas is competent too. some thorny issues are brought up: the troubles that women face at workplaces, the having to outsource child-care, the predators that lurk in the most unexpected places. but as often as the film astutely touches upon the tough choices, and the problems that can crop up, it leaves them, and us, hanging. you are left wanting a little more."
