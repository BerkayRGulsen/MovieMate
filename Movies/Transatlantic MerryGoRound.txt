transatlantic merry-go-round is a 1934 american drama film with musical and comedic elements, directed by benjamin stoloff.


== plot ==
gangster lee lother (sidney blackmer) is shot and killed during an ocean liner cruise, and we're introduced in flashback to the interwoven stories and characters of the suspects:  con-man and jewel-thief jimmy brett and his accomplice, a wife who bids goodbye to her husband without realizing he'll stowaway to spy on her, the star of the ship's entertainment revue and her brother with gambling debts, and the inspector who interrupts his vacation to solve the case.
the film's many musical numbers include a busby berkeley-like number with chorus girls in geometric patterns filmed from overhead. a song performed by the boswell sisters titled "rock and roll", written by richard a. whiting and sidney clare, is sometimes credited as the first use of that term in a popular song, although in this case the lyrics referred to the motion of the ocean.
