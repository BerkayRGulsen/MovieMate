== production ==
the idea behind another earth first developed out of director mike cahill and actress brit marling speculating as to what it would be like were one to encounter one's own self. in order to explore the possibility on a large scale, they devised the concept of a duplicate earth. the visual representation of the duplicate planet was deliberately made to evoke the moon, as cahill was deeply inspired by the 1969 apollo 11 lunar landing. this movie shares some of its plot details with the 1969 british sci-fi movie doppelganger.

another earth was filmed in and around new haven, connecticut, mike cahill's hometown  with some scenes taking place along the west haven shoreline and at west haven high school and union station  so that he could avail himself of the services of local friends and family and thus reduce expenses. his childhood home was used as rhoda's home and his bedroom as rhoda's room. the scene of the car collision was made possible through the help of a local police officer with whom cahill was acquainted, who cordoned off part of a highway late one night. the scene in which rhoda leaves the prison facility was filmed by having marling walk into an actual prison posing as a yoga instructor and then exiting.
according to brit marling, she approached william mapother for the role of john after "being haunted" by his performance in in the bedroom (2001). mapother consented to work on another earth for $100 a day. when asked why he agreed to join the cast, considering the "notoriously hit or miss" nature of independent films, mapother replied that he was drawn by the film's subject and by the names involved in the project. at mapother's insistence, he and the production team worked extensively on the scenes of john and rhoda in order to develop john's character in the film.the film ignores the physical consequences of having a similar-sized planet and moon appear nearby (e.g. effect on tides, gravity and atmosphere) other than depicting night time as brighter due to the reflection of the sun's light off the other planet. the dvd / blu-ray deleted scenes feature reveals that the film makers did intend to illustrate some of the consequences by filming a scene in which rhoda encounters flowers floating in mid-air, but the scene was cut from the final film.


== music ==

the musical score was composed by fall on your sword, with the exception of the song played in the musical saw scene, composed by scott munson and performed by natalia paruz. mike cahill came upon paruz, known also as the "saw lady", while riding the subway in new york. mesmerized by her playing, he obtained her contact information and arranged for her to coach william mapother on how to hold and act as if playing the saw for the scene in the film.
