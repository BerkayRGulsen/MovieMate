enduringly traumatized by the disappearance of her 3-year-old daughter 16 years ago, julia sandburg (weaver) has cut herself off from anyone once near and dear to her, including her husband doug and her son chris, who tried for years to penetrate her wall of isolation and despair, without success. but when julia meets louise (bosworth), a troubled young woman with a checkered past, all of julia's old psychological wounds painfully resurface, as does her illogical and increasingly irrational hope that louise may be the daughter she lost so long ago.
