== reception ==


=== critical response ===
when the film was released, film critic bosley crowther panned the film in his review, "all this is played out in tedious fashion before justice is satisfied, and inside job thankfully gives way to the newsreels and a couple of short subjects, which, though not too good either, are infinitely better than the main attraction."
