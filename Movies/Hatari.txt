in january 2019, hatari was confirmed as one of the ten acts competing in sngvakeppnin 2019, iceland's national selection for its entry in the eurovision song contest 2019, with their new song "hatri mun sigra". hatari won sngvakeppnin 2019 in march that year, and thus represented iceland in the eurovision song contest in may.in the lead-up to the competition, hatari made headlines with a number of political statements over the israeli occupation of palestine and other matters, resulting in jon ola sand, the executive supervisor of the european broadcasting union (ebu), warning them that they had reached the limit of the ebu's patience, and would be disqualified should they choose to bring its political statements to the stage. however, when iceland's televote score was announced at the end of the final, members of hatari held up banners displaying the flag of palestine. as a result, the ebu fined rv for 5,000, the lowest possible punishment. overall, hatari received 232 points in the final, finishing in 10th place.
