soon the son passes away; his look-alike son, devraj, comes to manage the estate. devraj does not consider bansiram's land a priority, and years go by. the aristocrat's soul wanders and waits in anguish and pain. when devraj goes to see bansiram, he finds an elderly semi-senile man and his grandson, chotu (aamir khan), who wants to produce alcohol on the land. devraj takes advantage of the situation with unpredictable results.
