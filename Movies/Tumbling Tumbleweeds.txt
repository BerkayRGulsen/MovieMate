== plot ==
gene autry (gene autry) returns to his home after a five-year absence as a singing cowboy with a group of strolling players that includes smiley (smiley burnette) and eightball (eugene jackson), who sell dr. parker's painless panacea. gene's father, a cattle barron and one of the original "nesters" in the west, was recently murdered during a conflict with his landlord.
while at an abandoned nester's cabin, the group is held up by harry brooks (cornelius keefe), whom gene recognizes as his old friend. wounded and semi-delirious, harry induces gene to hide him from the posse headed by sheriff manley (george burton). the deputy later returns and tries to shoot harry, but gene chases him away.
in town, the deputy reports to barney craven (edward hearn), leader of a gang which is trying to silence harry. meanwhile, gene and his friends set up a performance in town, but it is interrupted by craven's men, who report that harry is wanted for the murder of gene's father. hastening to harry's home, gene confronts his former sweetheart janet, now harry's wife, and meets janet's younger sister jerry (lucile browne), whom he had only known as a girl. they assure gene of harry's innocence and reveal that harry and gene's father were about to sign a settlement over disputed water rights.
now suspicious of craven, gene captures craven, the deputy, and their cohorts by a series of clever ruses that land them in jail, and thereby vindicates harry. gene and jerry marry and join smiley and eightball on the departing parker wagon.

== reception ==
in his review of the dvd release of the film for dvd talk, stuart galbraith iv wrote:

gene autry's first western for republic picturesindeed, it's regarded as the very first "singing cowboy" western everis one of his best, a very entertaining programmer that crams a lot of entertainment into its short-and-to-the-point 58 minutes. it's more a western with music than a typical gene autry western; although the basic components for the dozens of musical westerns autry would subsequently make for the studio are on display, it's pleasingly rough around the edges, without the formula blandness that would quickly permeate his films.
