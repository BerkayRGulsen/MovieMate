== production ==
george sidney later said "that was one of those cases where we had no script and we had a commitment. originally it was something about an arabian or something... but we turned it around and we wrote the script in about eleven days... we changed the whole thing and decided to do it in las vegas."in march 1963 mgm president robert o'brien announced viva las vegas starring elvis would be one of 20 made at the studio the following year. by may ann margret signed to co star. she was paid $15,000 a week over ten weeks. viva las vegas was filmed during the summer of 1963, before production of presley's film kissin' cousins, but was released after kissin' cousins in the summer of 1964.
in great britain, both the film and its soundtrack were sold as love in las vegas, since there was another, different film called viva las vegas that was being shown in british cinemas at the same time that presley's was released.
the chemistry between the two stars was genuine during filming. presley and ann-margret began an affair, and this received considerable attention from film and music gossip columnists. this reportedly led to a showdown with presley's worried girlfriend priscilla beaulieu. (elvis and priscilla married in 1967.) in her 1985 book elvis and me, priscilla presley describes the difficulties that she experienced when the gossip columnists erroneously "announced" that ann-margret and presley had become engaged to be married.
in her memoirs, ann-margret refers to elvis presley as her "soulmate" and stated: "we felt there was a need in 'the industry' for a female elvis presley."in addition, the filming of viva las vegas reportedly produced unusually heated exchanges between the director, film veteran george sidney,  and presley's manager, colonel tom parker, who was not credited as a "technical advisor" in the film's credits.
the arguments reportedly concerned the amount of time and effort allotted by the  cinematographer, joseph biroc, to the song and dance numbers that featured ann-margret, ostensibly on the orders of the director. these scenes include views of ann-margret's dancing taken from many different camera angles, the use of multiple cameras for each scene, and several retakes of each of her song-and-dance scenes.
david winters from the original cast of west side story was the film's choreographer and was recommended by ann-margret for the job. this was winters' first job as a choreographer on a feature film and ann-margret was his dance student at the time. because the film went over budget, parker would slash budgets for all remaining films in presley's career.
little church of the west, the oldest wedding chapel in las vegas, is the location used in the closing scene.
the scene where presley sings "viva las vegas" is performed in one single unedited shotthe only known example of such a technique in presley's film career.


== reception ==
the film grossed $9,442,967 at the box office, earning $5 million in u.s. theatrical rentals.for his role in viva las vegas, elvis presley received a third place prize 1965 laurel award for best male performance in a musical film. viva las vegas also received the 1965 laurel award for runner-up in the category of the best musical of 1964. ann-margret was praised for her on screen chemistry with elvis, as she nearly stole the film from him.
some critics in 1964 were lukewarm about viva las vegas, such as one for the new york times, who wrote: "viva las vegas, the new elvis presley vehicle, is about as pleasant and unimportant as a banana split." however, many others deduced the reasons why many members of the north american public liked the movie so much. variety stated in its review: "beyond several flashy musical numbers, a glamorous locale, and one electrifying auto race sequence, the production is a pretty trite and 'heavyhanded' affair". critical reaction notwithstanding, viva las vegas has become one of elvis presley's most popular and iconic films.
