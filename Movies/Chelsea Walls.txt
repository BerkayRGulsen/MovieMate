chelsea walls received negative reviews, currently holding a 26% rating on rotten tomatoes.roger ebert gave the film three stars out of four, claiming:  "movies like this do not grab you by the throat. you have to be receptive. the first time i saw "chelsea walls," in a stuffy room late at night at cannes 2001, i found it slow and pointless. this time, i saw it earlier in the day, fueled by coffee, and i understood that the movie is not about what the characters do, but about what they are. it may be a waste of time to spend your life drinking, fornicating, posing as a genius and living off your friends, but if you've got the money, honey, take off the time."
