== harvey films v. columbia pictures ==
on october 28, 1986, harvey films had a lawsuit with columbia pictures claiming that the logo for the film ghostbusters was similar to the logo for the ghostly trio, specifically the ghost in the logo was similar to fatso, and columbia argued that fatso was only a portion of their, at the time, renewed trademark, and there were three ghosts instead of just one. the court argued that the logos are largely dissimilar and that the ghostly trio had only the words of the trademark and the three ghosts while the logo for ghostbusters has a sign for prohibition with only the torso and head of only one ghost. the expressions are different, with their ghosts having mischievous or evil facial expressions, while the other one is bewildered. the court said "accordingly, the court concludes that the claimed likelihood of confusion has no material basis in fact. the sole evidence which harvey has produced on this issue are excerpts from magazine articles which suggest a general association between the "ghostbusters" logo and "casper" comics. it is clear from reading these articles that there was no confusion whatsoever on the part of the authors. a finding of general association, that the "ghostbusters" logo is reminiscent of "casper" characters, does not mean that the prospective moviegoer in purchasing a ticket for "ghostbusters" thinks that he is going to see a "casper" cartoon. neither does it mean that he will think that "ghostbusters" is derived from "casper" cartoons or that it is sponsored by the same source as "casper." " the court dismissed the case for not violating their trademark.
