in the english village of crythin gifford in 1889, three girls are having a tea party. suddenly, they notice a presence in the room; appearing entranced, the girls jump to their deaths from the bedroom window.
later, in 1906, in edwardian era london, lawyer arthur kipps's wife stella dies after giving birth to their son joseph. four years later, arthur is instructed to visit crythin gifford to retrieve any documents left by alice drablow, the deceased owner of eel marsh house, an isolated and desolate estate on the marshland, as a prelude to the sale of the house. upon arrival, arthur finds the villagers cold and unwelcoming, though he finds sympathy in wealthy local landowner samuel daily, who invites him to dinner.
the next morning, arthur meets mr. jerome, who tries to hurry him away from the village. undeterred, arthur travels to eel marsh house. there, he is distracted by odd noises, a bolted nursery, and a spectral entity in funerary garb. he hears sounds on the marshes of a carriage and a screaming child, but sees nobody on the causeway. he later tries to alert the village constable who dismisses his concerns. two children enter the station with their sister victoria, who has ingested lye, but she dies almost immediately.
that night, sam reveals that he and his wife elisabeth lost their young son to drowning. elisabeth suffers from fits of hysteria which she attributes to her son speaking through her. when sam attempts to take arthur to eel marsh the next day a gang of local men drive them off. victoria's father blames arthur for her death, as arthur saw "that woman" at eel marsh.
at the house, arthur uncovers correspondence between alice and her sister jennet humfrye. jennet demands to see her son nathaniel whom the drablows have formally adopted and barred her from contacting due to her being mentally unfit to care for him, which she denies. a death certificate reveals nathaniel drowned in a carriage accident on the marsh. jennet writes that she blames alice for saving only herself and leaving nathaniel's body in the marsh. another death certificates shows that jennet hanged herself from a beam in the nursery, vowing never to forgive alice.
that night arthur hears noises from the nursery, which is now unlocked.  from the nursery window arthur sees a boy crawling out of the ground and walking towards the house. he goes outside and sees dead children in the marshes, victoria among them. back in the house he sees an apparition of a woman hanging herself.
sam picks arthur up the next morning. in town, jerome's house catches fire with his daughter inside. when arthur attempts to save her, he sees the woman in black goading the girl into burning herself. the townspeople blame arthur for this death as well.
at her son's grave, elisabeth tells arthur that the woman in black is jennet, who claims the village children by having them take their lives in penance for her own son being taken from her. arthur realizes that his son joseph, who is coming to crythin gifford that night, is jennet's next victim. in an effort to lift the curse, arthur and sam find nathaniel's body in the marsh, and place it in his nursery, where arthur lures jennet to him. arthur and sam bury nathaniel with jennet, though her voice echoes through the house that she will never forgive the wrongs she suffered.
assuming jennet pacified, arthur meets joseph and his nanny at the railway station. while bidding farewell to sam, arthur sees the woman in black lure joseph onto the tracks. attempting to save him, both he and joseph are killed by the oncoming train. sam, horrified, sees the ghosts of the village children and the woman in black.
the train passes and, on the tracks, arthur and joseph are met by stella. the family is happily reunited as the woman in black looks on.
