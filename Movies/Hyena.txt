michael logan is a detective sergeant in london, working as part of a specialised taskforce alongside his friends and colleagues chris, martin and keith. the taskforce's unconventional and corrupt operations bring the officers into contact with european drug syndicates, with them happy to turn a blind eye to their dealings for either a cut, or electing to confiscate suppliers' merchandise for their own profit. logan meets with a contact in a turkish drug cartel, who is organising a large scale shipment that he has invested 100,000 into with the hope of netting an even better profit. however, during the meeting his contact is ambushed and attacked by members of a rival albanian gang, run by the kabashi brothers, looking to expand their power. logan meets with and aims to provide the albanians with the same service he provided the turks, but they aren't easily led.
meanwhile, he and his colleagues are being investigated by the professional standards department, headed up by detective inspector nick taylor. complicating matters further, logan is seconded from the taskforce to a new operation run by the vice unit, aiming at investigating the kabashi's involvement in people trafficking. it is headed up by di david knight, a former friend and colleague of logans who he fell out with a decade prior.
