was a box office bomb.


=== critical response ===
the film earned negative reviews from critics. the real mccoy holds an 22% rating on rotten tomatoes based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 4.13/10. roger ebert of the chicago sun-times gave it 2 stars, saying, "... "the real mccoy" took me back to... heist movies where a bank vault was subjected to high-tech manipulations by athletic super-crooks... those same scenes apparently took the film's authors back to the very same sources, since "the real mccoy" recycles the same devices, not quite as well as the originals."
