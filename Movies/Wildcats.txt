== plot ==
molly mcgrath is the daughter of a famed football coach who is dying to head her own team. when her wish is finally granted, molly leaves her job coaching girls' track at an affluent high school (prescott high school) to take over a football team at an inner-city chicago high school (central high school)--the kind of place where guard dogs are needed to patrol the campus. at first the new coach's idealism and optimism are suffocated with racial and gender prejudice, but eventually her overriding spirit begins to whip her unruly team into shape. molly hustles teenage criminal and former star football player levander bird williams into rejoining the team and adds the massive and comedic phillip finch. at the same time, she must also struggle to win a battle for the custody of her two young daughters. the real test for molly comes when her central high team faces prescott in the city championship.

the film currently holds a score of 22% on rotten tomatoes based on 18 reviews.roger ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and wrote, "the filmmakers, the producers and hawn herself bought the premise instead of looking for the plot. the problem with the movie is that they started with a character description instead of with a story. the fact that hawn plays a boys' football coach is not in itself interesting. her relationship with the team would have been interesting, if they'd developed one." gene siskel of the chicago tribune awarded 1 star out of 4 and called it a "pathetic sports comedy" that represented "another attempt to duplicate the success of hawn's genuinely funny, monster hit, 'private benjamin.'" janet maslin of the new york times wrote of hawn that "[t]he film isn't truly a waste of her talents, but neither does it give her a chance to do much more than repeat some familiar tricks."variety wrote that hawn had by now been "reduced to a type" of "the adorable but goofy independent woman," but she "is the least of the problems amid cardboard characters with cardboard conflicts ... football footage is also surprisingly dull, filmed mostly at close range making it look more like bodies bouncing off each other than a sport." patrick goldstein of the los angeles times called it "a good-natured but superficial comedysort of a 'bad news bears goes to the ghetto' ... the movie is such a well-oiled dream machine that it would have been nice if the story, for all its corny charm, had veered off in a more adventuresome or unpredictable direction." roger piantadosi of the washington post called it "a slick, fitfully charming little comedy that does nothing to deter those of us bent on being fond of goldie hawn forever. however, she is pushing her luck."in 2014, the movie was mentioned by keli goff in the daily beast in an article concerning white savior narratives in film.
