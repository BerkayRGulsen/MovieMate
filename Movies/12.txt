== plot ==
a 12-men jury decides whether a young chechen boy is guilty of the murder of his stepfather, a russian military officer. initially it seems that the boy was the murderer. however, one of the jurors, a foreman, votes in favour of acquittal. since the verdict must be rendered unanimously, the jurors review the case, and one by one come to the conclusion that the boy was framed. the murder was performed by criminals involved in the construction business. the discussion is repeatedly interrupted by flashbacks from the boy's wartime childhood.
in the end the foreman states that he was sure the boy did not commit the crime but he will not vote in favour of acquittal since the acquitted boy will be subsequently killed by the same criminals. in addition, the foreman reveals that he is a former intelligence officer. after a brief argument, the foreman agrees to join the majority. later the foreman tells the boy that he will find the real murderers.
