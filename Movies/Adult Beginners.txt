adult beginners received generally mixed reviews from critics. review aggregator rotten tomatoes gives the film a 48% approval rating based on reviews from 79 critics, with an average score of 5.76/10. the website's critical consensus reads: "perfectly pleasant yet never particularly engaging, adult beginners is a mild middle-of-the-road comedy content to coast on the charms of its talented cast." metacritic gives the film a score of 57 out of 100 based on reviews from 26 critics.adult beginners gained a fairly positive response at the toronto international film festival, with nikola grozdanovic of indiewire giving it a b+ grade, saying "its not perfect, but as far as feature debuts go, theres very little you can fault adult beginners for. slightly pedantic and maudlin at times, with telegraphed metaphors and some rushed pacing, its still hard to call any of these hiccups major flaws. katz, with the help of an inspired cast and an emotionally intelligent and mature screenplay, has succeeded in depicting the trials and tribulations of adults who, all for respectfully different yet equally weighty reasons, often make a three-year-old the most mature person in the room." he also praised the supporting roles of mchale, krawkowski, and particularly moynihan. phil brown of collider gave the film a b- grade calling it "cute". "its a very heartfelt, sweet, funny, moving and deliberately small movie that does exactly what its supposed to do and then rolks [sic] credits before wearing out its [sic] welcome. [...] its a little wisp of a comedy with enough warm sentiments and observations about eccentrically neurotic adults to slip in a little emotional sting."justin chang of variety said of the film that "its the sort of casual hangout vibe that feels so lived-in, its a shame when the film begins to devolve into the sort of rigged reconciliations and easy epiphanies it had largely avoided, up to a point. [...] still, those imperfections are forgivable, even fitting, for a modest, well-assembled charmer that represents a welcome branching out for most of the key talents involved." furthermore, at the south by southwest film festival, michael roffman of consequence of sound said "you dont need to rush out and see adult beginners. however, its an ideal netflix viewing in the near future, when the winter shifts into something awful and the afternoon begs for a little couching."
