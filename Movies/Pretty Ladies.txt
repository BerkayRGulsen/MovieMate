pretty ladies marked the first credited appearance of "lucille le sueur", soon to be known as joan crawford. according to lawrence j. quirk, author of the films of joan crawford, this film was the only time crawford was credited by her real name (crawford is also billed as lesueur in the 1925 promotional film mgm studio tour).
it was also one of the first screen appearances of myrna loy (then still performing under her real last name williams), who signed a seven-year contract with warner bros. in 1925 and then finally signed with mgm where she became a star in 1934 with the release of the thin man.
