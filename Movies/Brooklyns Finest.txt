== plot ==
bobby "carlo" powers and detective salvatore "sal" procida are having a conversation in a car when sal unexpectedly shoots carlo, grabs a bag of money from carlo's lap, and flees. sal later confesses the murder to a priest, asking for help with his dire situation: his wife is pregnant with twins, and they live in a house that is too small for their four existing children; it also has mold that jeopardizes his family's health.
desperate to move, sal has arranged to purchase a larger home through a woman who owes him a favor. the down payment is due the following tuesday, and sal is still short. sal, who is a highly skilled and accomplished narcotics detective, has begun to pickpocket drug money from raids.
officer edward "eddie" dugan is a week from retirement after 22 years of unremarkable service to the force. eddie is assigned to oversee rookies in the tough neighborhoods. however, his personal life is in shambles; as he swills whiskey in the morning to get out of bed, and the only person he can speak to honestly is chantel, a sex worker he hires regularly.
detective clarence "tango" butler is an undercover cop working the drug beat. after losing himself in his role as a drug dealer, tango is tired of the kind of attention attracted by a black man in a black bmw. having been promised a promotion including a desk job for years, butler is finally offered a way out if he betrays his close friend casanova "caz" phillips, a known criminal recently released from federal prison. federal agent smith instructs tango to set up the drug deal that will ensure caz's arrest and return to federal prison.
eddie's first rookie partner is a former marine, who becomes disgusted with eddie's perceived cowardice and cynical outlook. the rookie asks to be reassigned, but he is killed on his next assignment. eddie's second rookie partner accidentally fires his gun near a teenager during a petty theft investigation. the teenager goes deaf, leaving the nypd facing a public relations nightmare. during the investigation, eddie is remorseful for what happened but refuses to play along with his superiors' attempts to imply that the teenager was a drug dealer.
when tango warns caz to abort their upcoming drug deal, they are ambushed. caz is shot under orders from red, a gangster tango had previously humiliated. after smith makes a racist remark and refuses to pursue red, a furious tango lunges at her but fellow officers restrain him.
sal's latest raid on a complex is cancelled but he leaves to rob the money needed for his house. one of his team members, detective ronny rosario, tries but fails to stop sal from doing the raid. as he approaches the building, sal passes tango, who has come there to kill red. sal raids the apartment and, after killing three drug dealers, discovers their stockpile of cash. unfortunately, sal is shot and killed by a young man who became suspicious when he noticed sal entering the building.
after tango gets his revenge on red, an arriving rosario mistakens him for a gangster and shoots him in self-defence. only after shooting tango does rosario realize he has shot another officer. rosario, still determined to stop sal, leaves a wounded tango to continue his search for sal. rosario witnesses the young man who shot sal running away from the crime scene and is devastated when he finds sal's dead body in the apartment.
meanwhile, eddie retires and visits chantel, who declines his offer to move to connecticut. afterwards while sitting in his car contemplating suicide, eddie sees a woman who was reported missing being shoved into a van. he follows the van to the van dyke housing projects, where he locates a sex slave dungeon in the basement. eddie apprehends one of the men and is confronted by a second one.
when the second man does not comply with his orders to get on the floor, eddie shoots him once in the chest, beginning a violent fight that ends with eddie strangling his opponent with a zip tie. eddie finds redemption by rescuing the missing girls.

michael c. martin, the writer of the screenplay, went to south shore high school, where a film appreciation course sparked his interest, and an anterior cruciate ligament injury derailed a possible basketball career. he studied film at brooklyn college. after having been injured in a car accident in 2005, martin wrote the finest script for a screenwriter's contest  he did not win but his second prize included a subscription to the independent feature project newsletter. the script also continued to gain attention. martin found an agent interested in having him write a sequel to the successful film new jack city. he finally found someone interested in producing his script for finest, for which he received $200,000.in an interview at the time of the movie's release, martin described development of the film:

"jeanne obrien-ebiri and mary viola are responsible for getting this movie made. jeanne was the first person in the industry to read the script and she was responsible for getting me an agent and the staff job (as a staff writer on the showtime series sleeper cell). and once the script was out there, it came across mary violas desk at thunder road pictures as a writing sample for new jack city 2. mary, a native new yorker, worked like hell to sell it to the head of thunder road, basil iwanyk. basil was an executive on training day, he had a great relationship with antoine. and once antoine attached himself to the script, richard gere, don cheadle, wesley snipes, and ethan hawke followed. within weeks, it received a green light."
as inspiration for the finest script, martin named three italian neorealist films, nights of cabiria, umberto d., and bicycle thief, and two directors, italian vittorio de sica, who directed umberto and thief among others, and american jim jarmusch.in the interview, martin identified his south shore film teacher as mr. braun.

the los angeles times reviewer commented that "brooklyn's finest is an old style potboiler about desperate cops in dire straits that overcooks both its story and its stars."
