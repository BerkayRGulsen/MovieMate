we just used ideas that were fresh at that time and tried to make something that nobody else had, (...) the song came really fast. i had the idea for the melodies in about 45 minutes and the total structure of the song was done in a day and a half.

== critical reception ==
allmusic editor jose f. promis called "what is love" "one of the 1990s' quintessential dance tunes". victor beigelman from the a.v. club deemed it a "europop banger that more than 20 years later remains relentlessly catchy and far more profound than it ever had any right to be." larry flick from billboard described it as a "glorious pop/house ditty" and stated that "wildly catchy chorus is complemented by a slick, synth-happy arrangement. haddaway will conjure up images of seal and sydney youngblood with his worldly baritone delivery. a sure-fire dance hit that has the muscle to push its way onto pop formats with ease." milo miles from the boston globe wrote, "he pours such delicacy and anguish into the short phrases they become loud whispers that stay in the ear. with perfectly lubricated synthesizers bouncing away behind him, haddaway gets precious mileage out of minimal lyrics." columbia daily spectator said it "will transport you instantly to the golden age of house music." jim farber from daily news noted that "what is love" "uses every sound it has to punch the beat: a stabbing synth line, a tense bass, an uplifting lead vocal and an encouragingly frantic female voice to back it up. it's a sound at once insinuating and insistent, sensual and wild." he also deemed it "the world's natural followup" to robin s.' "show me love". dave sholin from the gavin report commented, "try sitting still seconds after this upbeat entry kicks in." he also noted that haddaway's style is "reminscent of the fine young cannibals and just as exciting." mike wood from idolator called it a "catchy" anthem that "permeated our collective consciousness given the heavily-repeated airplay". music & media said it has a "fast house beat augmented by nestor haddaway's deeply soulful vocals. this is definitely on par with anything that has come out of chicago's deep house scene for quite some time." wendi cermak from the network forty described the track as "splendiferous" and noted that "the eargasmic synth stabs in the extended mix are pulling even odds in vegas for dance-floor-filling capability and the edit screams for radio airplay..." luke turner from the quietus wrote that "what is love" "bangs because it manages to be two thingsa terrific soul tune but also rather stern as well, with infernally naggy synth lines and drilled repetition in the rhythms."
