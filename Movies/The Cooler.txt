the cooler is a 2003 american romantic drama film directed by wayne kramer. the original screenplay was written by kramer and frank hannah. in old-school gambling parlance, a casino "cooler" is an unlucky individual, usually a casino employee, whose mere presence at the gambling tables usually results in a streak of bad luck for the other players.


== plot ==
unlucky bernie lootz (william h. macy) works at the shangri-la casino as a "cooler" - a man with near professionally bad luck, his presence at a casino designed to stop people from winning.  a cocktail waitress, natalie (maria bello), takes no real notice of bernie, who is smitten with her.  the casino manager and partner, shelly (alec baldwin) prides himself on running a "classically" las vegas casino, and resents the new places that attract a lower clientele.  the owners, however, hire an advisor named larry (ron livingston) to help bring in more money with techniques contrary to shelly's outdated policies.  bernie informs shelly that he's leaving town in a week.
after an encounter during which bernie rescues natalie from an aggressive customer, she appears to take an interest in him.  secretly prodded by casino owner shelly, natalie asks bernie out for a drink. they end up sleeping together, and then natalie takes a genuine interest in bernie. they begin seeing each other, but bernie is apprehensive due to his mostly bad luck. shelly initially thought a relationship with natalie would keep bernie from leaving his casino. bernie reveals to natalie that he used to be a gambling addict, and was in huge debt to several casinos.  shelly "saved" him by breaking his kneecap, and paying off his debts, in exchange for bernie's work as a cooler for 6 years, which ends at the end of the week.  by accident, bernie and natalie run into his estranged son mikey and his pregnant wife charlotte who are scamming a diner by faking labor.  bernie tells mikey to stop by the casino sometime.
bernie is happy with his new relationship and his "cooling" abilities fade, much to shelly's anger. mikey and charlotte come by the casino and bernie gives them $3,000, but natalie is skeptical of charlotte's behavior. when bernie reveals to natalie he intends to leave vegas, she initially says she won't go with him, and bernie is upset. when bernie intentionally fails to cool a hot table which is being cheated by mikey, shelly takes mikey and charlotte downstairs and his crew begins beating mikey.  bernie then promises to pay the $150,000 mikey was up, but shelly breaks mikey's hand and punches charlotte--that reveals charlotte's pregnancy was being faked anyway.  though distraught, that night natalie and bernie confess their love for one another, and bernie again becomes a good luck charm.
shelly calls natalie to his office and reminds her that he hired her to date bernie so he wouldn't leave vegas, not to fall in love with him, which has made him both happy and lucky.  he forces her to leave town abruptly, which hurts bernie and ruins his luck.  she does truly love bernie, though, and returns, restoring bernie's luck.  shelly goes to bernie's motel room and begins packing for natalie and hits her, cutting her face.  after a tense exchange wherein she claims bernie is the closest thing shelly has to a friend and he doesn't want him to leave, he simply leaves her there.  when bernie comes home, she reveals shelly hired her to pretend to like him, but she actually fell for him.
banking on his good luck brought on by natalie's devotion, bernie confronts shelly and calls him a coward with nothing in his life but the casino.  shelly lets him go on the condition he pay back the $150,000, which bernie tries to win at craps.  bernie leaves and he and natalie drive away from vegas.  he pulls over and reveals that he won a lot of money, but a motorcycle cop approaches and readies to kill them.  shelly gets in his car and finds his partner waiting for him.  on larry's behalf, he whacks shelly, presumably for letting bernie go with his winnings.  a drunk driver accidentally hits and kills the cop, presumably sent to whack bernie, and natalie and bernie drive off.

== critical reception ==
the film received generally positive reviews from critics with considerable praise for alec baldwin's performance. writing for the new york times, a. o. scott said, "the setting ... is a little tired, and the premise is pretty hokey. mr. kramer, rather than trying to discover anything new, is content to recycle familiar characters and story lines. the script ... and the direction are skillful, if occasionally gimmicky ... luckily this picture is rescued from clich by the quality of the acting, and mr. kramer wisely gives the actors room to work."on rotten tomatoes the film a has a 77% "certified fresh" approval rating based on 174 reviews, with an average rating of 6.75/10. the site's consensus reads: "a small movie elevated by superb performances." on metacritic, the film has a score of 69 out of 100 based on 36 reviews, indicating "generally positive reviews".roger ebert of the chicago sun-times said the film "has a strange way of being broad and twisted at the same time, so that while we surf the surface of the story, unexpected developments are stirring beneath ... this is a movie without gimmicks, hooks or flashy slickness ... the acting is on the money, the writing has substance, the direction knows when to evoke film noir and when ... to get fancy."in rolling stone, peter travers rated the film 3 out of a possible four stars and added, "wayne kramer, who co-wrote the scrappy script with frank hannah, makes a potent directing debut and strikes gold with the cast... top of the line is baldwin, whose revelatory portrayal of an old vegas hard-liner in thrall to the town's faded allure is the stuff oscars are made of. from james whitaker's seductive camerawork to mark isham's lush score, the cooler places all the smart bets and hits the jackpot."mark holcomb of the village voice said, "taking a page from the sin city cinema revisionist's handbook, the cooler mimics the vegas insider's perspective of casino (without scorsese's fetishistic attention to detail), the seedy/saccharine insouciance of fx's lucky (devoid of quirky chutzpah), and the couch-potato glitz of nbc's las vegas ... what's left never gels as fantasy, drama, or romantic comedy... [the] film never amounts to more than a cute idea stretched to poker-chip thinness."
