== plot ==
detective chief inspector gregory (patrick holt) from scotland yard, and his partner, sergeant conway (bruce beeby), are called in to investigate the shotgun murder of a woman at rosehill cottage, a remote surrey cottage. the victim appears to be ann rogers (honor blackman), the wife of womanising artist howard rogers (emrys jones). her face, however, is so badly disfigured by the two shotgun blasts, it is hard to be sure of her identity. rogers looks for a birthmark that would positively prove the body belongs to his wife, but it is not there. 
at first, gregory had considered rogers as the chief suspect, but his alibi proves he is innocent. when ann suddenly shows up, the identity of the murdered woman may rest on one of the artist's models, claire matthews, who is missing. a search for both the artist's mistress, serena vaughan, and the missing model intensifies, but ann's motivations are also suspect. one of the women may know the truth.
