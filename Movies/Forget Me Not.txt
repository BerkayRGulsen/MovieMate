== reception ==
on rotten tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 69% based on reviews from 13 critics. 
dennis harvey in variety found the film "a pleasant if slender affair reminiscent of before sunrise, with a little once tossed in", that "moves gracefully toward a conclusion that will trigger tears from some viewers, though others may find it a bit too heavy a tragic load for the film to bear." tom huddleston in time out, wrote that "a frequent criticism of ultra-low-budget independent movies is that they try to do too much. 'forget me not' may even be guilty of doing too little  but what it does attempt, it largely pulls off" and concluded that "ambitious it ain't, but forget me not is a modest, memorable and rather moving slice of diy cinema, despite the lack of bears in the london eye." patrick smith in the daily telegraph compared the film to richard linklater's before sunrise and before sunset, but found that although it "isn't quite as accomplished", menzies and o'reilly have enough chemistry for the climax to be surprisingly poignant." roger ebert concluded that the film resembles linklater's films, but "moves along too deliberately", and although the ending "conceals an emotional impact, sad and carefully orchestrated...the film isn't very compelling."


== awards ==
the film won best uk film and best editing at the 2015 london independent film festival and the golden ace at the las vegas film festival.
