== reception ==
matt molgaard of best horror movies wrote, "this is a stirring flick, and in truth, id be holding back if i called shadow people anything other than an outstanding success that far exceeded expectations...shadow people has already established itself as one of 2013s most inspired efforts." david maine of pop matters wrote, "shadow people is a spooky little movie that could have been much spookier, but still makes good use of its limited means to convey an unsettling story."  ain't it cool news declared "it made me think twice about turning on the light as i went to bed. any film that does that is a winner in my book."   brad mchargue of dread central rated the film 1.5/5 stars and called the film "novel and ambitious" but too messy to fulfill the potential of the premise.  pat torfe of bloody disgusting rated the film 2.5/5 stars.  torfe said that shadow people lacks balance and "doesn't know what it is." thomas marcum of the crypto crew said "the movie is well done all the way around and well worth watching".
