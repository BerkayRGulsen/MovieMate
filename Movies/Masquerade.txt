== plot ==
the confusing and conspiratorial 15th ruler of korea's joseon dynasty king gwang-hae (lee byung-hun) orders his secretary of defense, heo gyun (ryu seung-ryong), to find him a double in order to avoid the constant threat of assassination. in constant fear of being poisoned, the king becomes obnoxious and threatens everyone around him, including the kitchen maids. heo gyun finds ha-sun, a lowly acrobat and bawdy joker who looks remarkably like the king to replace the king occasionally whenever the king is out of the palace. in few days, just as feared, king gwang-hae is drugged with poppy by his favorite consort, conspired by the law minister. heo gyun proposes ha-sun fill the role as the king until king gwang-hae fully recovers and grooms ha-sun to look and act like the king. while assuming the role of the king at his first official appearance, ha-sun begins to ponder the intricacies of the problems debated in his court. being fundamentally more humanitarian than king gwang-hae, ha-sun's affection and appreciation of even the most minor servants slowly changes morale in the palace for the better. over time he finds his voice and takes control of governing the country with real insight and fair judgments. even heo gyun and the chief eunuch are moved by ha-sun's genuine concern for the people, and realize he is a better ruler than gwang-hae. ha-sun even fights for the respect of the queen's safety and protects her and her brother from death sentences.  however, his chief opposition, park chung-seo (kim myung-gon), notices the sudden shift in the king's behavior and starts to ask questions. the queen (han hyo-joo) is also conflicted between the real king and the fake king's secret. the chief eunuch and the secretary of defense ask ha-sun to leave the country for good. the king was again brought back to the throne to punish the revolts.

== background ==
historically, gwanghae, the 15th joseon king from 1608 to 1623, attempted diplomacy through neutrality as china's ming dynasty (1368-1644) and qing dynasty (1636-1912) set their sights on the country. he also tried his hand at other reforms and reconstruction to try to make the nation prosperous, including an emphasis on the restoration of documents, but met with opposition and was later deposed and exiled to jeju island. since he was deposed in a coup by the westerners faction, historians did not give him a temple name like taejo or sejong.the premise behind the film is an interpretation of the missing 15 days in the seungjeongwon ilgi or journal of the royal secretariat during gwanghae's reigndesignated by his 1616 journal entry, "one must not record that which he wishes to hide." that premise is entirely fictitious in nature. this is because

the journal in itself is largely incomplete due to records being destroyed several times and reproductions of the destroyed documents also eventually being destroyed, leading to large missing chunks of records or questionable reproductions that may or may not have been edited every subsequent reproduction.
relevant records written during the reign of gwanghae are also largely missing.
even if the journal were complete, it is highly unlikely the secretariat would delete or omit records, even by order of the king due to protocol. in fact, due to that same protocol the only thing that would happen is that after having received word or having witnessed a certain incident and subsequently ordered to not record it, the secretariat would record the incident in full and finish the entry stating the king ordered him not to do so.
a prime example of the above would be when taejong fell off his horse when hunting one day and asked the secretariat to not record this in the journal. the secretariat however went and recorded the incident and ended his entry with 'and his majesty asked that the secretariat not record this'
