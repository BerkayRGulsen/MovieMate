== background ==
manjunatha is an aspect of shiva. manju means 'snow' and natha means 'lord.' since lord shiva resides on mount kailash, and hence the ruler of the himalaya mountains, as he is the lord of that loka (dimension), he is called manjunatha.
manjunatha is one of the most common names in karnataka state for males and manjula for females. both are commonly called by the nickname name "manju."  this is mostly because of the sri dharmasthala manjunatha swami temple located in sri kshethra dharmasthala.


== plot ==
manjunatha (arjun sarja) is an atheist, but a good person helping others in need and fighting evil and so even though manjunatha hates his namesake lord shiva  (chiranjeevi), the latter loves his would be devotee. being an atheist, manjunatha always scolds lord shiva which is watched by his vehicle nandi (dwarakish) and  his attendant bhrungi (mimicry dayanand). manjunatha meets katyayini (soundarya) a to-become devadasi (servant of the lord) and marries her. soon they beget a son, siddhartha ("siddhu"), who like his mother is a staunch devotee of lord shiva.
after marriage manjunatha realizes the existence of lord shiva and slowly transforms himself into a great devotee of lord shiva and with his devotion, lights the lamps of the manjunatha temple in dharmasthala without using a matchstick and wins the hearts of everybody including the local king, ambikeswara maharaju (ambareesh) who invites him to his court where he felicitates manjunatha much to manjunatha's dislike where the king realises that manjunatha is going to die.
in the meantime manjunatha starts a koti lingam puja with over 1,000 lingams worshipped and both manjunatha and the king singing the lingashtakam and performin the puja. manjunatha is also troubled by his enemies and is aided by lord shiva who comes in various disguises to save his devotee and help him and his wife attain salvation.
