sit tight is a 1931 american pre-code musical comedy film, directed by lloyd bacon, written by rex taylor, edited by james gibbon, and produced and distributed by warner bros. it was originally intended as a full musical, but due to the backlash against musicals, all the songs were cut from the film except for one  sung by winnie lightner  in all release prints in the united states.


== plot ==
winnie is the head of a health clinic and has jojo (played by joe e. brown) as one of her employees. jojo is a wrestler  forced to enter the ring and face down a musclebound masked opponent olaf (played by frank hagney). making matters worse, the masked marauder is convinced his wife has been fooling around with jojo. jojo is knocked out early in the proceedings, whereupon he dreams he is a sultan surrounded by harem girls.
a romantic subplot involves tom (played by paul gregory) and sally (played by claudia dell). tom works for sally's father. sally asks her father to give tom a promotion so she can spend more time with him. when tom refuses to be promoted without earning the position, she threatens to have him fired and he quits his job. tom attempts to begin a new career as a championship wrestler and is trained by winnie and jojo. when sally learns about this, she attempts to stop him and asks for his forgiveness. she pleads with him to not fight but he has already pledged to do so.
