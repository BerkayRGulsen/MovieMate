three rebellious teenage girls decide to even the score in the battle of the sexes. looking back a few years after the events depicted, jefferson roth (who, along with her sisters are named after former presidents) tells the story of the last few months of her senior year at a wisconsin boarding school when she and two girl friends, the naive lisa and the outrageous karen, conspire to use a pistol to turn the tables on males after a wealthy older man, with whom karen had a one-night stand, refuses to give her his home phone number. they stage a sexual assault on david, lisa's on-and-off boyfriend, in an effort to try to be more like their male counterparts. however, it backfires, as all three girls learn they are not able to have sex the way they feel a man can. their unfaithfulness to their own objective is summed up in karen's words, just prior to her tragic ending, "i wish i had a boyfriend."
