== reception ==
the film received mixed to positive reviews from film critics. kam williams gave the film a "very good" review, saying, "[i]t's well-enough executed, especially for a flick on a modest budget, to forgive the low production values and a tendency towards melodrama." michael dequina of the movie report said, "foster's film confirms the unique, undeniable power this genre can achieve on both stage and film..." john anderson of variety gave the film a mixed review, saying, "stan foster, making his directorial debut, has reared a 'preacher's kid' that's largely wooden, unlikely in many spots and, despite the few hard-edges of his script, could have used a tougher sensibility. the results are a movie that doesn't quite know what it wants to be. but, overall it was a good movie."
