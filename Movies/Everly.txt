== plot ==
everly (salma hayek), trapped into sexual slavery or abused and assaulted working for the brutal japanese criminal overlord taiko (hiroyuki watanabe), is attacked in her apartment by taiko's enforcers after he discovers that she has been working with a police officer to damage his organization. however, though taiko expected his men to kill her easily after torturing her, everly retrieves a gun she had hidden in the toilet and manages to kill all of her attackers. taiko then begins a sadistic game of toying with everly, dispatching numerous hired killers and offering the other prostitutes in the building (which he presumably owns) a bounty if they manage to kill her. meanwhile, everly attempts to contact her mother edith (laura cepeda) and young daughter maisey (aisha ayamah) to save them from other henchmen of taiko and get them out of the situation alive, but her mother is being stubborn and reuses to leave without her. 
after managing to evade taiko's attackers for an extended period of time, everly is captured by the sadist (togo igawa), an assistant of taiko's. he has her tied up and placed in a cage while he taunts and tortures her with battery and sulfuric acid, along with other corrosive liquids, at one point pouring water into her eyes while she screams in fear, believing it is acid. when the sadist pours some of the corrosive liquid onto a rope binding her wrist, the rope starts disintegrating. edith shoots and kills two of the sadist's henchmen; in return, he begins forcing her mother to drink drain cleaner. the rope collapses after everly tugs on it; she kills two of the henchmen and wounds the sadist. she rushes to help edith, but is subdued by the sadist, who attempts to stab her mother; everly resurfaces, disarms the sadist and forces him to drink one of his acids; he dies violently as everly and edith watch in horror.
it is revealed that everly was a prisoner in the plush apartment after being kidnapped by taiko four years earlier and forced into sexual slavery. she has had no contact with edith or maisey during that time, and her mother is confused and angry at the deadly situation they are suddenly thrust into. as everly fights off the numerous attacks, some of the hoes become more outlandish; originally they are simply armed thugs, but the sadist's team appear in costumes and plan for extravagant tortures. the final surge is from a group of what appears to be specialized troops or police officers.
eventually, edith is killed by a sniper hired by taiko from the building across from the apartment. the sniper meant to kill everly but missed. when the sniper shoots a rocket-propelled grenade into the apartment, taiko beheads him in anger, believing that he killed everly, though she survives. everly is finally subdued, but manages to kill taiko after his soldiers have left by stabbing him with his own sword. one of the sadist's compatriots, the masochist, attempts to slash maisey before everly kills him with a single headshot. afterwards, everly reconciles with maisey, who was under the protection of one of everly's enslaved neighbors (who was eventually killed). the film closes with everly seemingly succumbing to her wounds, but with maisey still alive and potentially safe with the death of taiko. however, immediately before the credits, there is audio of a beeping heart-monitor and gasp of breath to indicate that everly has not died after all.
