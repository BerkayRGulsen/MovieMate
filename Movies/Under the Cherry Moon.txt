filming started at the victorine studios in nice, france on september 14, 1985 directed by mary lambert, the director behind some of madonna's and janet jackson's most popular music videos, but after disagreements about the film's direction, she left the production on november 4 after 16 days of filming and prince took over directing himself. lambert is listed as a creative consultant in the film's credits.the cast was also changed during pre-production. prince originally had planned to have susannah melvoin (sister of revolution member wendy melvoin, as well as prince's girlfriend at the time) play mary sharon, but it was clear she couldn't act and prince replaced her with kristin scott thomas (in her feature debut).


== soundtrack ==

under the cherry moon, along with its soundtrack album, marked the first of many recorded collaborations between prince and jazz keyboardist/composer-arranger clare fischer, whose orchestral arrangements had by this time become highly demanded by pop and r&b acts, stemming from his initial arrangements for rufus and chaka khan in the early 1970s. appearing in the credits as "orchestra composed and arranged by...," fischer's contribution was further acknowledged by prince in both the film's closing titles and the album's liner notes:
