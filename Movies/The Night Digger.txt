== critical reception ==
in a contemporary review, the new york times wrote "it begs for empathy for its tortured principals, but despite the clearly dedicated contributions of patricia neal, roald dahl, her scenarist-husband; pamela brown and a young newcomer, nicholas clay, the strain on credibility is a good deal more notable than the impact on the emotions"; while more recently, a reviewer for dvd talk wrote "the night digger doesn't carry much of a reputation, but i found it highly unusual, and more than satisfying". cinema retro called it "an underrated gem"; and the radio times concluded "director alastair reid's neo-grand guignol chamber piece exudes a peculiar fascination".
