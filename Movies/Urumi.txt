== plot ==
the executives of the multinational mining corporation nirvana group inform goa-based krishna das (prithviraj sukumaran) that his ancestral property in north kerala, leased out to a non-governmental organisation (ngo) by his late grandfather, is both rich in minerals and able to be sold because the lease period has expired. nirvana group offers him a large sum of money as an advance on the purchase. the ngo currently runs a tribal school on the property, which is situated inside the kannadi forest range. when krishna das and his friend thanseer (prabhu deva) visit the property, they are kidnapped by local tribal men and taken to a cave deep in the forest. there, krishna das meets the tribal chief thangachan (arya), who explains to him that he is the descendant of a certain chirakkal kelu nayanar.
in the early 16th century, the portuguese sailors under vasco da gama (alexx o'nell) captured a muslim pilgrim ship and took all the passengers as prisoners. the general of chirakkal kingdom (northern kerala), the kothuwal, sends a brahmin negotiator and his own son, kelu (as per the customs of the land), to the captured ship to negotiate the prisoners' release. however, vasco da gama viciously rejects their attempt at negotiation, cutting off the negotiator's ears. he then orders that the prisoners be locked in the hold and the ship set on fire. kothuwal storms the burning ship to rescue his son, kelu. although kelu escapes, chirakkal kothuwal is killed during the rescue attempt. vavvali, a tamil muslim boy, takes orphaned kelu with him to his home, and treats him as his brother. kelu crafts an urumi from the leftover ornaments of the dead women and children of the pilgrim ship. he takes an oath to one day kill vasco da gama.
kelu and vavvali are next seen as adults hunting in a forest somewhere in chirakkal. they rescue the princess of chirakkal, bala (nithya menon), from a group of abductors, armed with portuguese pistols, who apparently have been organised by her cousin, bhanu vikraman (ankur khanna). under the orders of bhanu vikraman, kelu and vavvali are soon captured by the chirakkal guards at puthoor ferry and tried before the king of chirakkal (amole gupte). in the trial, it is revealed to the king that the two young men in fact saved the princess' life. chenichery kurup (jagathy sreekumar), minister of the king, convinces the king that the abductors might have been from arakkal kingdom.
the king grants kelu and vavvali an audience. during the conversation, kelu learns that vasco da gama is scheduled to return to india as the viceroy. they plan to infiltrate and capture da gama during the hanging of "pirate" balia hassan, at fort arakkal. however, they instead capture estvo da gama (alexx o'nell) and bring him as a prisoner to chirakkal. in the process, kelu and vavvali come across and are helped by ayesha (genelia d'souza), a fiery warrior princess of arakkal palace. with the help of ayesha, balia hassan is also freed from the gallows and chaos ensues. unknownst to kelu and vavvali, a group of chirakkal warriors simultaneously raid the arakkal palace, assassinates the harabichi beevi and take a large number of women from the palace as prisoners. back in chirakkal, the king bestows kelu with the honour of being the new general ("kothuval"). vavvali, however, is somewhat unhappy as the king neglected to acknowledge his role in the capture of estvo. princess ayesha - among captives from the raid in arakkal - is presented to the spoiled prince bhanu vikraman as a concubine. she tries to kill the prince in his chamber, but kelu saves him. vasco da gama, in cochin, is enraged to know the capture and mutilation of his son estvo. later, kelu helps ayesha escape from chirakkal and asks her to flee from "this cursed land". ayesha, with the help of kelu and vavvali, manages to rescue all the women locked up in chirakkal and smuggle them to a secret cave in puthur.
with princess ayesha, kelu and vavvali set out to the villages in the kingdom and succeed in garnering support from the common folk against the portuguese. a large number of people join with kelu and ayesha to form a resistance. kelu also induces the king of chirakkal to seek assistance from the syrian christians in kodungallur. meanwhile, with the help of minister kurup (sreekumar), bhanu vikraman conspires against his uncle and joins forces with estvo da gama. bhanu vikraman assassinates his uncle with a portuguese pistol. kelu returns to chirakkal palace to discuss with vikraman, now king of chirakkal, what actions to take against da gama, but bhanu hesitantly states that the army will no longer take orders from kelu. chirakkal bala, the princess of chirakkal, now joins with kelu and his cohorts. meanwhile, da gama (robin pratt), accompanied by estvo da gama among others, arrives at the chirakkal palace. chenichery kurup, whom da gama remembers at first sight, welcomes him. during the audience, bhanu vikraman is killed by estvo da gama. as a mark of respect for his allegiance to the portuguese crown, the empire offers kurup the post of the governor general of the laccadives.
the chirakkal army, led by angadan nambi, attacks the rebel hideout. rebels under kelu, vavvali, ayesha and defected chirakkal general kaimal, fight back. soon, an estvo da gama-led portuguese unit arrives in the village as reinforcement for the chirakkal force. the rebels manage to defeat the combined forces, but vavvali is killed in action. the rebels now launch an attack on the chirakkal palace. a terrible battle ensues. the rebels are immediately put on the defensive by the portuguese cannons. kelu manages to breach the perimeter set up by estvo and enters the palace. he manages to attack da gama but is killed by the musketeers.
after hearing the moving story of his ancestors, krishna das decides not to sell his land to the multinational mining corporation and instead, he decides to start a new life in kerala.

according to director santosh sivan, urumi is his comment on globalization. he adds that the film resonates with people today as corporate lobbies are causing displacement of indigenous people across the world. "i have travelled across the world while shooting for films and documentaries and i have seen first hand the displacement and exploitation, the side effects of globalisation being suffered by the people who live in close contact to nature. the film centres around a similar situation, but it is removed by a few centuries," said sivan. the film also focuses on a new perspective of storytelling. "history is written by the victors, the powerful who won. so was vasco da gama a brave explorer or an invader after gold." he added."the film is designed in such a way that it talks about the present and the past. in the past, some people came and exploited our land and it is happening even now. perhaps the people who lived then are the people who live now. still we are not united and our progress is not uniform. the film has also portrayed this aspect in a different manner.", sivan pointed out to jyothsna bhavanishankar of "behind the woods".shankar ramakrishnan, who wrote the story and screenplay for urumi after conducting extensive research, said that the film presents history from a different perspective. "even a small child in kerala perceives vasco da gama as an explorer, who made the first-ever colonial invasion in any part of the world. but there's more to him than that. urumi is an attempt to portray or rather discuss the many realities that could have affected the course of our history," he said. shankar ramakrishnan added that the title is not just suggestive of kelu's weapon urumi, but "the feeling of vengeance that we carry in our hearts".


== production ==

in april 2011, prithviraj sukumaran explained the genesis of his production company: "santosh [sivan] and i used to keep discussing a historical film during the making of [2010 tamil film] raavanan. we roped in shaji nadesan, a friend of ours, and thus was born august cinema." "i like the idea of recreating the bygone era. it is interesting to think of the characters you have heard as real. also, it excited me to have cannons, swords, and urumi (curling blades) in a film." santosh sivan was quite enthusiastic about the idea.santosh sivan and prithviraj sukumaran have acknowledged the vital role played by the script writer shankar ramakrishnan in shaping of film. ramakrishnan, who had been working for some time as film-maker ranjith balakrishnan's associate director, had scripted a tale for a competition based on the medieval history of kerala. "called chekavar, it was on the gallant warriors of malabar and the pageant of the mamankam. i had shown it to prithviraj [sukumaran] during the shooting of thirakkatha. he was quite taken up with the script and mentioned it to santhosh [sivan] when the two were working on raavanan. that is how santosh [sivan] got in touch with me," explains shankar ramakrishnan. "i was nearly imprisoned in santosh sivan's flat in mumbai for about two months when i was writing the story of urumi. finally, i told him the one-line story of a boy who wanted to kill vasco da gama and the movie took off smoothly from then on. i did not see it as a period film as i felt that the issues it dealt with were contemporary", reveals shankar ramakrishnan. shankar spent two years gathering the material for his script and doing research to flesh out his characters, some of whom are familiar names in indian history. he went to kannur and read old ballads and stories of the region.alexx o'neill, who hails from connecticut in the united states, was cast as estvo da gama. "when i had signed urumi, it was basically for a single character estvo da gama, but later i played [young] vasco da gama's role, too, and had to speak only in portuguese", o'neill said. "i wanted to be very true to the accent and the way the character would speak at that time. so i hired a person in mumbai before the shooting began. even during the dubbing i had someone to assist me, so that i don't go wrong with the pronunciation", he added.the 16th century costumes were designed by debutant eka lakhani, with make-up by ranjith ambady. the clothing worn by the characters, particularly that worn by the women, differed slightly from what would be historically accurate attire. "you cannot re-create exactly how it was then, as women were topless in those days. so, you stylise the kind of dresses they wore in that era," sivan said to rediff. shooting for the film started on 17 august 2010. the production design was carried out by sunil babu. the main locations were kerala and the forests of malshej ghat in maharashtra. most of the scenes were captured in mostly natural light with a modest of budget and minimal visual effects. "it was tedious and the terrain was difficult. on screen, it looks beautiful but we shot standing in slush almost 24/7. people got foot infections. it was laborious", says nithya menon, who played a chirakkal princess. the film was shot with a combination of various formats. the canon eos 5d was extensively used, especially for the sensuous song featuring vidya balan. the shooting lasted a period of seven months in the states of kerala, karnataka and maharashtra.urumi was filmed by three cinematographers  santosh sivan (who is the director of photography as well), renowned wild-life photographer alphonse roy, and national award-winning anjuli shukla. "shooting in the mist-laden harishchadragad in malshej valley is a difficult task as the light keeps changing constantly. it rains incessantly and the entire area is covered in slush. so each scene is a challenge. it is great to be a part of such a talented team," says anjuli. sunil babu, the set designer for movies such as ghajini, lakshya and ananthabhadram, was art director for the film. visual effects were carried out by mumbai-based reliance mediaworks.
santosh sivan was heavily involved in bringing out a "tailored version" of the film in telugu 2011, and in tamil in 2012. many scenes in the film were re-shot to avoid lip-sync problems.


=== the english version ===
the english version is expected to be just 110 minutes long, which is 55 minutes shorter than the malayalam film. the director confirmed that the english version will showcase the brutal side of the portuguese invader. the english version will be released in 2015. "the english flick, titled "vasco da gama", is totally different from the malayalam version in terms of structure and story. "we will be retaining only 30% of the scenes from the original", said santosh sivan, adding that the extra sequences are already shot. the script is being sponsored by a forum of the hong kong international film festival.

"the hindu" wrote of the tamil version, "from the very first scene of this film to the last, director-cum-cinematographer santosh sivan proves to be on top of this technical masterpiece. the songs, waterfall sequences and the war scenes evoke a feel of realism due to its stunning visuals and brilliant re-recording. certain portions in the film become very melodramatic to suit the indian audiences thereby derailing the pace. the brilliantly choreographed action sequences seem to be a tad too loud for the ears." notable websites and tamil magazines praised the dialog of the tamil version. the film was released as "ek yodha shoorveer" in hindi in 2016 and was widely criticised for "laughable dubbing".the film has also caught the eye of academy award-winning filmmaker oliver stone. "i had met stone while he was in mumbai a few months ago and he was curious when he came to know that i was doing a film on da gama. we had a discussion about it and he wanted me to send him a copy once the film was done," said santosh sivan.
