born in montreal, quebec, andrew godefroy read history at concordia university.  his early academic work was in the field of canadian military history with a particular focus on canada and the first world war.  his first book published in 1998 - for freedom and honour? - a study of the death penalty in canada's canadian expeditionary force based on his undergraduate thesis, received critical praise in both media and academia circles and drew much attention to this long forgotten and politically sensitive subject.
his graduate studies focused on innovation and conflict, earning him both an ma and ph.d. in war studies from the royal military college of canada.  his master's thesis examined u.s.-canada cooperation and public policy in missile defence and space programs, while his post-graduate dissertation examined the nature of defence innovation, using the evolution of canada's post war rocket and space program, and the relationships created between government, defence, and science and technology in canada as his case study.  he was the first person in canada to declassify and examine several of the earliest records on canadian post-war rocketry, upper atmospheric, and space research during the completion of his doctorate.  his subsequent publication of this research initiated a fundamental reassessment of canada's political and security roles in missile defence and outer space during the early cold war period.
during 2009-2010 he held the canadian visiting research fellowship in the changing character of warfare program at the university of oxford.  his research focused on why and how western armies change, with specific attention given to the evolution of british, american, and canadian armies during the cold war period and beyond.
