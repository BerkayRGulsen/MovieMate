== plot ==
a russian peasant family is eating dinner when a truck stops in the front yard. the father opens the door of the truck to find a dead woman and two crying infants in the seat next to her. 
marie jones, an american woman, is seen in a russian hotel room making a call to her daughter; she then goes to meet a local notary, who tells her that she has inherited some property, and that she should visit it. having been taken to the wooded island, she finds that the house is dilapidated and inhabited by zombie-like creatures, one of whom looks like her. having attempted to escape, she meets nikolai, who tells her that they are twins, adopted separately following the murder of their mother.
the house seems to change at random between a state of dilapidation and a state of domestication. threatened by the zombie-like creatures, nikolai shoots one of them in the leg, only to find that the wound appears on his own body. he deduces that they are his and marie's doppelgngers, and that 'what happens to them happens to us'. when nikolai falls into a hole in the floor while the house is dilapidated, marie is unable to rescue him as the hole suddenly is sealed when the house changes to a domesticated state. 
marie attempts to escape by rowing across the river. after a lengthy walk on the opposite bank, she happens upon a house, only to find that it is the house she has escaped from, with nikolai inside. he explains that their father intended to kill them along with their mother when they were babies, and that they cannot leave until he has managed to reunite the family in death. the house reverts to its state on the night of the murder, and they see their father returning home. 
nikolai tells marie that they can escape in the truck along with their mother and their younger selves. while searching for the truck, marie finds her father's now desiccated body in the barn, and is then pushed into a pseudo-past where she realizes her father and the notary are the same person. she flees his office in the present and runs into her past self as she comes up the steps, and continues fleeing into the sunlight until she finds herself back in the house, this time between the past and the present, where the apparition of her father explains that he has always loved his children and his wife, and could not let them leave him. she runs from him and finds nikolai's body being eaten by boars. when her doppelgnger comes after her, marie flees to the truck parked outside and drives away.
marie's father's voice comes over the radio, telling her to return and join the family he has created. the bridge that brought her there has been destroyed, and she plunges into the river, drowning. the film ends with marie's daughter, emily, explaining that she knew her mother would never return. it has been a long time since her mother left for russia and emily has never had the desire to know what happened to marie or her parents, breaking the cycle and leaving her abandoned.

== production ==
the film was originally written by karim hussain and set to be directed by him, but it was shelved. nacho cerd, a friend of hussain's who had been impressed by the screenplay, later suggested the film as a project for filmax. as hussain was involved in another film at the time, cerd took over directing duties. richard stanley was brought in to polish the script. for casting, cerd insisted on an unknown actor to star, despite the studio pushing for nastassja kinski or holly hunter. the film was originally known as los abandonados, under which it played at sitges film festival. cerd disliked that name, but stanley preferred that, as it sounded like a spaghetti western. cerd is a fan of slow-paced, atmospheric horror films and wanted to make something that wasn't a saw or hostel clone. major themes include the past, emotional dependency and forging your own identity.
