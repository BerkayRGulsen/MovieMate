increasingly adam is unable to determine the difference between fantasy and reality and believes that, as a warlock, he is on a quest to kill various people.  as the bodies pile up, the local police are baffled and no one suspects that adam is a deranged serial killer being commanded to kill by the devil.
after playing the role playing game with instructions to kill all the members of the apostles of hell before they kill him, adam attends a costume party hosted by a man named dr. evil, who wants adam to join his cult and also kill most of the party guests. when the police figure out that adam is the killer, they corner and shoot him in a factory, but his body disappears and leaves a puppet in its place.
at the end of the film, the surviving players are playing a game with a suit of knight's armor seated in adam's place. the armor comes to life and kills their dungeon master. upon looking at the body, they learn that their dungeon master was dr. evil, and by extension, the devil.
