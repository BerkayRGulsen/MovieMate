edward small first announced plans to film the novel in 1944 and hired george bruce to write a screenplay in 1946.in 1946 small sent representatives to britain to scout locations. he said he wanted to make the film on location in scotland. charles bennett and george bruce worked on the early drafts of the script. in 1948 small said he would make the film as co-production with j arthur rank starring louis hayward .in 1948 alfred hitchcock announced plans to film the novel for transatlantic pictures. small claimed he had registered the title in the us; hitchcock could film the story but would not be able to call it lorna doone in the us. this prompted small to announce he would start filming in england in association with rank and producer john beck on 1 march 1949. this was postponed due to the usenglish film trade war of 194819 and in august 1949 filming was put back indefinitely.the project was reactivated later in 1949 when small signed a two-picture deal with columbia pictures, for lorna doone and the brigand.


=== shooting ===
it was decided to make the movie in hollywood, with locations shot at yosemite national park. richard greene and barbara hale were cast in the leads and jesse lasky jr did the final draft of the script. filming began 17 may1950. the final script was heavily influenced by westerns."whatever has been put on screen has been done with considerable loyalty to the novel," said greene. "i don't think the british public will find too much fault with the treatment. what may be missed is the cornish atmosphere."ron randell, who played several leads for sam katzman, had a support role.
