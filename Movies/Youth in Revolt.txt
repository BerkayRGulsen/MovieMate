shy teenager nick twisp lives with his mother, estelle, and her boyfriend, jerry, in oakland, california. after selling a faulty car to a group of sailors, jerry takes estelle and nick to a trailer park in clearlake where nick meets sheeni saunders, a young woman his age, interested in french culture and sharing nick's musical taste. despite her boyfriend, trent preston, they become romantically involved. nick gets a dog for her named albert (after albert camus), but albert rips up the family's property and sheeni's parents ban it from the house.
before nick returns to oakland, sheeni promises to arrange a job in ukiah for nick's father, george, while nick agrees to get his mother to kick him out so he can return to sheeni. in oakland, nick creates an alter-ego named franois dillinger, a suave, rebellious troublemaker. immediately after, jerry dies of a heart attack. 
under franois' influence, nick mouths off to his mom and her new boyfriend, police officer lance wescock. nick takes jerry's lincoln, and crashes into a restaurant, starting a fire. lance agrees to lie and report the car stolen in return for living with his father. in ukiah, nick phones sheeni and tells her he blew up "half of berkeley" to return. her mother overhears this and ship her to a french boarding school in santa cruz, forbidding nick ever to see her again.
nick befriends vijay joshi, and they take vijay's grandmother's car to visit sheeni. they sneak into sheeni's room, nick meets bernice in the bathroom, and he claims trent said terrible things about her. later, bernice brings the matron to the room and the boys flee. on the way home, the car dies and nick calls mr. ferguson, his father's idealist neighbor, to pick them up; telling ferguson that vijay is an illegal immigrant whom nick is trying to "free from persecution".
when he returns home, nick meets sheeni's older brother, paul, who tells him that she will be returning home at thanksgiving and invites him. nick sends bernice letters asking her to slip sedatives into sheeni's drinks to make her sleep in class, getting sheeni expelled. nick finds lacey, george's 25-year-old girlfriend, paul, and ferguson, in his living room, high on mushrooms, and nick joins them. when george finds them he punches ferguson, and paul punches george. lacey leaves the house to live with paul. on thanksgiving day, nick receives a call from his mother explaining lance left and will not cover for him anymore. then, at sheeni's. trent unexpectedly arrives and tells them about nick's letters to bernice; sheeni is horrified and nick leaves.
nick steals his father's car to escape the police, then removes his clothes and drives the car into a shallow lake in front of the police station. he gets a wig and dress to impersonate one of sheeni's "friends". he fools mr. and mrs. saunders, going up to sheeni's room. upstairs, nick tells sheeni that he understands what loneliness is like, and that everything he has done (burning down berkeley, destroying his parents' cars and having her sedated) was all so that they wouldn't have to be alone anymore. sheeni forgives nick, and they have sex, finally achieving nick's dream of losing his virginity. trent barges in, telling them he's brought the police. nick beats up trent and asks sheeni to wait for him; she reassures him that he will only be in juvenile detention for three months.
the animated closing credits show nick in jail with franois helping him. when nick is released, sheeni shows up in a car and they drive away into the sky towards the paris skyline, as various characters appear to make amends and give them their blessing.
