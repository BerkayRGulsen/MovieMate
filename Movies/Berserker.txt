== reception ==
andrew smith from popcorn pictures awarded the film a score of 3/10, writing, berserker sounded great and could have become a little slasher gem but the lack of the berserker on-screen is disappointing and gentle ben the bear doesnt have any need to be in here. one to avoid unless you have a burning desire to see every 80s slasher film". todd martin from horrornews.net offered the film similar criticism, calling it "a boring, confusing, hokey, mess of a film". will and roni agree that the viking element was underplayed.
