the film is based on the true story of carl synnerdahl, a convict who posed as a blind man to get a lighter sentence and had been forced to keep up the deception. he told his story to literary agent rosemary cresswell, who was doing some work for the department of corrective services, who in turn told the story to producer errol sullivan. several directors were approached to make the movie but turned it down, including bruce beresford, michael thornhill, phillip noyce and esben storm. eventually british director claude whatham was imported, which was highly controversial because the movie was made with funds from the australian tax payer.
