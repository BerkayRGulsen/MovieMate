tina hirsch had edited three films for corman in the 1970s. in the mid 80s she wanted to direct and told him. corman wanted to make a gremlins knock off, which were profitable at the time, and since hirsch had edited that film it seemed a good fit. munchies was shot over 12 days, followed by three days of filming puppets and inserts.
