the film follows the lives of roman and lucy, two people living difficult lives in a small, frozen town of apex, nunavut, canada. they are in love, but lucy tells roman that she must leave as a stalker has followed her. roman tells her that he cannot leave and go south again, because of dark things in his own past. he tries to get her to go without him, and is even pushed to the brink of suicide. eventually, he knows that he must go with her.
roman can talk to bears which only he, it seems, can hear talking back, and a polar bear who talks to him about life makes several appearances in the story. on their snowmobile journey south, they are warned of a blizzard, but seek shelter in an abandoned military base instead of going back. lucy comes to believe that her stalker has followed them there. it is then revealed that the stalker is in her mind, her dead abusive father. roman burns the military base in order to prove that her father is now dead forever and can no longer follow her.
seeking shelter in a snow cave, roman and lucy talk about a herd of caribou that they had found frozen in a lake earlier in their journey. they compare their lives to these animals, being led on a path and unable to get off, with all of them drowning. as the lovers begin to succumb to the intense temperature, the bear appears again, revealing that he is god and promising to roman that he and lucy will see each other again. the final scene shows the lovers' now dead, frozen bodies being cut out of the snow and lifted away by a helicopter.
