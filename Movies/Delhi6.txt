== plot ==
roshan accompanies his dying grandmother annapurna to their ancestral property in old delhi where he is initially stunned by the mad rush of neighbours: ali baig the renaissance man, feuding brothers madangopal and jaigopal, their wives and families, mamdu the confectioner, gobar the simpleton, sethji and many others. roshan accompanies his grandmother to the ramleelas, hangs out at mamdu's sweet stall, plays with the children, and gradually becomes steeped in the culture. when annapurna faints due to fluctuating blood sugar levels and everyone scrambles to get her to a hospital, roshan finds the roads choked by traffic because of an impromptu ceremony around a cow in labour; he is further surprised when his grandmother, despite her stupor, stumbles forth to seek the blessings of the cow and the local police seem to encourage the practice. roshan begins to understand the feuds and social issues in the community. madangopal's sister rama is unwed and jaigopal's electrical business is going nowhere. the lecherous old local money lender lala bhairam's wife shashi is having an affair with a young photo-studio hand suresh, a double timer also pursuing madangopal's daughter bittu who secretly prepares to audition for a popular reality show indian idol. roshan is surprised to learn that ali baig fancied his mother many years ago and has since never married. roshan also comes to empathize with the lower-caste trash collector girl jalebi, and crosses paths with the loutish inspector ranvijay who blithely stretches his authorities to manhandle the locals.
on the other hand, the media is all abuzz with tales of a miscreant known as the "kala bandar" who attacks, steals and has caused the death of a few innocent people. after some initial friction, roshan and bittu warm to each other. roshan intervenes when he learns of madangopal trying to get bittu married against her wishes, but earns madangopal's wrath. while supporting her dreams, he gradually begins to fall in love with her but is confused when she expresses her affections for suresh. around this time, the kb attacks old delhi. in order to exorcise the demonic influence of the kb, the locals bring in a tantrik shani baba who speculates that the local mosque must have been built over the ruins of a temple that was demolished for the purpose, thus initiating a vicious cycle of animosity in the previously harmonious hindu-muslim community. after the initial peaceful demonstrations, a mob goes on rampage and attacks some of the muslims and their shops, including mamdu's sweet shop. this prompts mamdu to set fire to the tree temple. roshan attempts to make peace but is rebuffed because of his mixed religious parentage. the locals ultimately settle on the fact that the kb is hiding out in the sooni galli (a dark lane known to harbour evil presences), and command gobar to fetch a lock of hair from the evil enemy so that the tantrik can burn it and complete the exorcism.
roshan becomes aware of bittu's plan to elope with suresh and dons a monkey outfit, stealthily following bittu by leaping across the rooftops. in the meantime gobar ventures into the sooni galli where jalebi gives him a lock of her hair so he may return in triumph and bring peace to the community. at that moment, roshan (in his monkey outfit) intercedes in bittu and suresh's rendezvous and causes the cowardly suresh to flee. bittu raises a loud alarm before roshan unmasks himself, expresses his feelings for her which she reciprocates. the angry locals storm the place and beat up roshan, believing him to the kb, before mamdu shoots him. gobar then proclaims that the kb is in fact the vices residing inside the people of delhi 6 and something they must defeat within themselves. the neighborhood realizes this and arranges for an ambulance. roshan does not respond to the treatment, leaving people to believe that he died. in the meanwhile, the nearly dying roshan meets his dead grandfather who reveals that there is a kala bandar in his own heart and that is why he wanted to ask forgiveness to his daughter-in-law, roshan's mother, for not accepting her inter-religious marriage. soon, he responds to the treatment and survives, much to everyone's happiness.
