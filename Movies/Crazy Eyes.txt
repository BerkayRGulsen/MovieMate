== critical reception ==
from geoff henao of flixist:

the problem with crazy eyes is that it's just too real. because of this, it's a bit uncomfortable to watch. the best way to describe it is that there isn't any "movie magic" to save it; that is to say, there aren't any normal movie thematics or elements that would influence the plot to heighten the protagonist's likability... the end result is just messy and bad. much like a long day of drinking, crazy eyes results in a horrible hangover you regret ever putting yourself through.
