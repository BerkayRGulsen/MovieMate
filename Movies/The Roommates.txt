== controversy ==
some of the promotional posters and displays for the film used the christy administration building from southwestern college in winfield, kansas as its backdrop. the college administration voiced concern that permission to use the photograph of the building was not properly obtained and investigated the legality of its use.primary concerns hinged that the image of the college (particularly the image of the building) could be damaged, while other concerns were that the college's primary iconic image was being used for promotion of an unrelated business venture.though the film successfully earned $15.6 million in receipts to top the box office during its debut weekend in the united states, concerns continued. by that time, the image of the building had been replaced on the film's official website and on subsequent promotional material. the photo of the building reportedly was licensed from istockphoto based in calgary, alberta. as of february 8, 2011, no lawsuits had been filed but discussions had taken place.students at the school reported "mixed feelings" about the topic  some believed that it may have been helpful for the college and others reported that they saw how it could have been harmful to the school's image.
