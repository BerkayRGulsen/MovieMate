young gitty, an 11-year-old girl living on a farm in 1980s rural america, tries not to worry about her family losing the farm and seeks to escape the stress of her home by exploring the farm and its lands. she is shocked to discover, however, that the developer buying up local farms is now seemingly being kept prisoner in the family's old abandoned grain silo at the edge of the farm. gitty begins spending time with the man, ultimately finding herself torn between loyalty to what she thinks is right, and loyalty to her own family. all is not as it may seem, though, as the family finds itself involved with individuals who are like something out of a fairy tale.
