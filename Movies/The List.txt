many have considered 2007 to be one of the greatest years for film in the 21st century.
in his article from april 18, 2017, which highlighted the best movies of 2007, critic mark allison of den of geek said, "2007 must surely be remembered as one of the finest years in english-language film-making, quite possibly the best of this century so far. like 1939, 1976, or 1994, it was one of those years in which a succession of veritable classics came into being. so many, in fact, that some of the best examples were cruelly overlooked by the hype machine of the day." he also emphasized, "if 2007 proves anything, its that classic films arent just a relic of ages past; theyre being made all around us. i cant wait to see what were watching in another ten years time."critic craig johnson from the film review and movie list website taste of cinema said in an article from december 16, 2014, "for one glorious year, it (2007) was like the 1970s all over again. smart characters were using their brains as weapons. movie stars were challenging themselves with tough roles. punches were not pulled. happy endings were not guaranteed. there was a parade of intelligent movies, seemingly made for adults to watch while the kids were watching transformers".
