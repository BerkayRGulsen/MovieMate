rogue is a 2007 australian independent horror film written, produced and directed by greg mclean, about a group of tourists in australia who fall prey to a giant, 25 ft (7.6 m) man-eating crocodile. it stars radha mitchell, michael vartan, and sam worthington.
the film was inspired by the true story of sweetheart, a giant male saltwater crocodile that attacked boats in the late 1970s, although sweetheart was never responsible for an attack on a human. rogue received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure. 
it is the second and last film from dimension films to have the involvement of village roadshow pictures since 1992's fortress.


== plot ==
american travel journalist pete mckell (michael vartan) joins a small group of tourists on a crocodile-watching river cruise in kakadu national park of australia's northern territory, led by wildlife researcher kate ryan (radha mitchell). toward the end of the cruise, everett (robert taylor) spots a flare in the distance and the group head up river to investigate. they eventually come across a half-sunken wreck when something crashes into their boat, splitting the side.
kate manages to steer the boat ashore a small island in the middle of the river. moments after, everett is pulled into the water by an unseen predator and disappears. kate realises they are in a crocodile's territory and explains they must leave the island by nightfall, as the tide will start to rise and the island will be submerged. two locals, neil (sam worthington) and collin (damien richardson), arrive at the island but the crocodile smashes into their boat; neil manages to swim to the island safely but collin is killed.
as night falls, neil carefully swims to the riverbank in order to string a rope between two trees, creating a zip-line that will allow the group to cross the river. everett's wife mary ellen (caroline brazier) crosses first, only to freeze in fear halfway across. allen (geoff morrell), becoming impatient and aggressive, attempts to get himself and his daughter sherry (mia wasikowska) across with mary ellen still on the line. while trying to secure the rope, neil is attacked and killed by the crocodile. the tree holding the rope breaks and the three on the line fall into the water. they manage to swim back to the island, but as allen crawls up the shore, the huge crocodile lunges out of the water and throws him back into the river where he is dragged under.
later that night, pete suggests they should use bait on a hook to distract the crocodile on one side of the island while everyone else swims to the riverbank; kate hooks two dead birds. after a long wait, the anchor is suddenly pulled and the group make a break for the far shore. the crocodile suddenly lets go of the bait, seizes kate and drags her underwater. pete hurriedly makes the swim across the river with kate's dog kevin in tow and heads off into the bush to meet up with the others.
as day breaks, pete is forced to chase kevin into the bush after he runs off. he falls down a narrow chute into a large cave, where he discovers neil's mangled corpse. he realises that the cave is the crocodile's lair and, to his surprise, finds kate alive but badly injured. pete attempts to carry her out but the crocodile returns. it makes several attempts to kill them both and pete's hand gets severely bitten. pete then props a large broken log against a boulder, with the sharp end pointing outwards, and as the crocodile lunges at him, pete successfully impales it through the head, killing it. he escapes from the cave with kate to join the surviving tourists and waiting paramedics.
as the credits roll, the camera focuses on a newspaper article detailing pete's heroic battle with the beast and rescue of kate.
