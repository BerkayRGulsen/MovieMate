== critical reception ==
caryn james of the new york times hated the film:

[the lemon sisters] inspires dazed disbelief that professional film makers could have made such an amateurish movie... among the other wasted talents is the director, joyce chopra, who once made the exquisite, troubling little film smooth talk and seems to have lost her judgment here.
