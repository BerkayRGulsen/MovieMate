== evaluation in film guides ==
steven h. scheuer's tv movie almanac & ratings 1958 & 1959 gives borderline a "fair" rating of 2 stars (out of 4), summarizing its plot as "[a] policewoman is sent to get the goods on dope smugglers working from los angeles to mexico" with the evaluation, "[u]ncertain melodrama wavers between seriousness and farce, is successful at neither". 35 years later, in the 19931994 edition, the plot was revised to "[a] policewoman goes undercover as a chorus girl to crack a ring of drug smugglers".
leonard maltin's tv movies & video guide (1989 edition) slightly raises the rating to 2 stars (out of 4) and concludes that "trevor and macmurray work well together as law enforcers each tracking down dope smugglers on mexican border, neither knowing the other isn't a crook". by the time of the third edition (2015) of maltin's classic movie guide, the rating had been lowered to the scheuer level of 2 and the write-up changed to "[o]dd thriller-comedy in which l.a. cop trevor attempts to gather evidence against wily drug smuggler burr while mixing with tough guy macmurray in mexico. starts out promisingly, but soon bogs down in silliness. burr makes a vivid villain."
