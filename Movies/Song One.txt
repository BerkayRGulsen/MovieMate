== production ==
initially, franny was written as 19 years old, however after anne hathaway came aboard, barker-froyland rewrote the part to be that of an older woman, which she notes worked well for the script as it gave franny more reason to not want to be a musician. hathaway's previous movie les misrables required her to adopt a shorter hair style than usual, rather than make her regrow the hair, the director incorporated it into the script.filming of song one began in june 2013 in new york city.


== soundtrack ==
the soundtrack, released by lakeshore records on january 13, 2015, contained original scores written by jenny lewis and johnathan rice of the indie rock duo jenny & johnny. barker-froyland met with the duo in los angeles and, after she listened to "little yellow dress" before her plane ride to new york, decided that they would create the songs that flynn would perform in-character.
