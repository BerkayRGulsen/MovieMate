== plot ==
the story begins in london in 1950. a gang of robbers led by the self-proclaimed george "the great" brain (sid james) rob a bank, stealing 50,000. they choose a hearse as a getaway vehicle and are pursued and caught by the police. however, before being caught they manage to conceal the money (which is in a briefcase) in the trunk of a hollow tree, before all three are arrested. the gang are sentenced to serve fifteen years in wormwood scrubs prison.
upon their release in 1965, the gang go back to the spot where they had left the money, only to find it is now a new town, and a housing estate has been built around the tree. they are dismayed that the tree now lies in the grounds of the local police station - but it is invitingly close to the boundary wall. george and his gang take up rooms in a nearby house rented from a widow and her daughter who also live there. they rent two double rooms on the first floor. in order to provide a respectable front, george reluctantly agrees to marry his longtime girlfriend myrtle robbins (sylvia syms) who is not so enamoured about the idea of recovering the loot and wants george to settle down with her.
the incompetent criminals fail in their numerous attempts to get over or under the wall, all the while trying to conceal their true activities from their landlady (joan sims), her daughter (edina ronay) and a local police constable (jim dale) who also stays there. eventually, when the men have botched an attempt to tunnel into the grounds, the frustrated women hatch their own plot to gain the money, and succeed, only to find that the money has been shredded by mice nesting in the tree.

== critical reception ==
time out wrote, "this 'unofficial' carry on reproduces the familiar formula of its virtually institutionalised predecessors."


== production ==
peter rogers had a script for what eventually would be the big job, but elected not to incorporate it into the carry on series. of the principal cast, only sylvia syms and dick emery did not feature in at least one carry on.  the film was principally shot at pinewood studios, with exteriors at silver hill, chalfont st giles (the bank), fulmer and bracknell (residential and town streets) and iver heath, buckinghamshire (countryside).
