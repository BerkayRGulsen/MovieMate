== plot ==
rajashilpi is the re-telling of the legend about lord shiva. the plot of the story is constructed in a way that the events in the legend repeats itself in a new setting with different characters but with the same spiritual auras of the main persons, especially siva and sati. the first image of durga is maintained throughout the film, durga is the re-incarnated uma. only after durga comes to be aware of her re-incarnated life as uma that she is able to fall in love with shambu. until then her seductive tactics go in vain. the death of durga's father is shown very differently in the film. it is as if the shiva is doing his thandava, the dance of siva out of his rage that symbolizes destruction of this universe-life of cause and effect.
