=== the verger ===
a new vicar (michael hordern) at st peter's church is astonished to learn that the long-serving verger, albert foreman (james hayter), is lliterate. foreman is too set in his ways to want to learn to read, amd the vicar feels he has no choice but to sack him. on the way back to his lodgings foreman notices that there is no tobacconist's shop in the area and decides to open one. he also proposes to his landlady, emma (kathleen harrison). their shop is so successful that when his stepdaughter's husband loses his job foreman sets up another shop for them to run. over the next ten years foreman starts up more and more shops, and becomes wealthy. the bank manager (felix aylmer) recommends that foreman invest his savings, causing foreman to reveal that he cannot read the necessary papers. the manager exclaims, "what would you be today if you had been able to?" foreman replies that he would be the verger at st peter's.


=== mr know-all ===
reserved mr gray (wilfred hyde-white) finds himself forced to share a cabin on an ocean liner with the loud, opinionated, supremely self-confident gem dealer max kelada (nigel patrick). kelada soon dominates all the onboard social gatherings, much to the annoyance of his fellow passengers, who take to calling him "mr know-all" behind his back because of his insistence that he is an expert on all subjects. one night kelada remarks on the fine quality of the pearl necklace worn by mrs ramsay (anne crawford), who has rejoined her husband (naunton wayne) after a two-year separation caused by his work. mr ramsay bets kelada ten pounds that the pearls are fake. kelada accepts the wager, despite mrs ramsay's attempt to call it off. while he is examining the pearls kelada observes that the woman is very uneasy. he then says that he was wrong and pays mr ramsay. afterwards, back in their cabin, gray and kelada are surprised when two five-pound notes are slipped under their door in an envelope. gray gets kelada to tell the truth: the pearls are real and very costly. kelada adds that he would not have left such an attractive wife alone for that long. gray begins to warm to his cabin mate.


=== sanatorium ===
this segment is based on "sanatorium", which was first published in ashenden: or the british agent.
mr ashenden (roland culver) is sent to a sanatorium and becomes acquainted with the other residents. another newcomer is major george templeton (michael rennie), who admires the lovely evie bishop (jean simmons). evie has spent years in one sanatorium after another. ashenden also observes the feud between two longterm patients, mr campbell (john laurie) and mr mcleod (finlay currie), who delight in making each other's lives miserable. one more patient, mr chester (raymond huntley), resents the visits of his wife (betty ann davies) because he envies her robust good health. mcleod dies, depriving campbell of his enjoyment of life. after george and evie fall in love the doctors warn them that george will hasten his death if they marry, but they decide that happiness, no matter how brief, is worth the price. their example eases mr chester's bitterness about his own fate.
