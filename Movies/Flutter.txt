== production ==
shia, who grew up in saskatchewan, was in montreal when he was approached by nfb producer michael fukushima and asked if he had any ideas he wanted to present. he offered a few ideas before remembering some earlier art work he had done of a "kid with wings on his feet" while working with the nfb on his first project, a 30-second short ice ages. this artwork became the inspiration for flutter.flutter is animated in black and white. it took shia and his team 10 months to complete and was animated using photoshop, which the filmmaker used because of his unfamiliarity with animation software at the time, and because he wanted the film to "look as hand-drawn and gritty as possible."several people who had grown up with shia in saskatoon worked on flutter, including his brothers leo and tim, who played music for the film, and friends kelly sommerfield (background art) and ryan patterson (sound engineering).
