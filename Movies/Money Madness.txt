=== critical response ===
film critic dennis schwartz, while giving the film a mixed review, liked the feature, writing, "a low-grade film noir that has its chilling moments. it opens with julie saunders (frances rafferty) sentenced to a prison term of ten years for being an accomplice to murder. a flashback is used to show how a sweet girl like julie could have gotten into such deep trouble ... beaumont went on to be ward cleaver in television's leave it to beaver, but here he's great to watch as a sleazeball and sicko killer. it's film where it takes a suspension of belief to get through all the problems built into the implausible plot, but nevertheless the film has a certain insanity kicking in that somehow works to give it an edge."
