after starting in two swashbuckling films before this; captain blood and the charge of the light brigade flynn had asked warner brothers for a regular non-swashbuckling role and this film was the result. however, after this flynn's next film was the prince and the pauper.
originally warner brothers announced that leslie howard would be the star and he was scheduled to begin filming green light at the end of june, 1935, after completion of his run in the petrified forest on broadway but a persistent bout of boils which repeatedly landed him in the hospital throughout the production made it necessary for howard to take an extended rest instead. warners then announced the leads would be flynn and olivia de havilland. de havilland dropped out and the female leads were then to be played by anita louise and ann dvorak. dvorak was then replaced by margaret lindsay.
