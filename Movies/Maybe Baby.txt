maybe baby is a 2000 british comedy film starring hugh laurie and joely richardson. it was written and directed by ben elton, with laurie directing some scenes in an uncredited role, and based upon elton's 1999 novel, inconceivable. the film was a critical failure, and did not do well at the box office, despite a cast including many of the best-known names within comedy in britain.


== plot ==
sam bell (hugh laurie) and his wife lucy (joely richardson) are a married couple struggling for a baby, having tried everything they can think of to improve their chances of conceiving. at the same time, sam begins to find his job (as a commissioning editor of drama at the bbc) increasingly unfulfilling. while he resolves to write his own screenplay, he begins to suffer writer's block.
the idea dawns upon him to write about his own predicament, something to which lucy objects strongly. he uses her diary entries to help him achieve authenticity, and the film is a success. lucy finds out about the film and, shocked, leaves sam. eventually they reconcile, and at the end of the story are still trying for a baby.
it marks the second time laurie and richardson have starred in the same film; the first was 101 dalmatians (although in that film they shared no scenes).
