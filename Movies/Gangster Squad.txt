== plot ==
in 1949 los angeles, mafia boss mickey cohen has become the most powerful figure in the california criminal underworld and intends to expand his criminal enterprise to encompass the entire west coast. the lapd has not been able to stop cohen's ruthless rise, as he has eliminated witnesses, hired dirty cops to protect his criminal activities, and shielded himself from prosecution through corruption in the justice system.
determined to put a stop to cohen, lapd chief bill parker creates a secret police unit tasked with dismantling cohen's enterprise. the unit, composed of officers who do not carry badges and are authorized to act outside of the law, are led by the skilled world war ii oss veteran, sergeant john o'mara. with the help of his wife, connie, he recruits detective jerry wooters and four incorruptible misfit officers  black lieutenant coleman harris, wire tapping expert and family man conwell keeler, sharpshooter max kennard, and kennard's hispanic protg navidad ramirez. calling themselves the "gangster squad", they begin the task of destroying cohen's operations.
despite some initial set backs such as a casino raid being thwarted by the corrupt burbank police department, the squad strikes several successful blows at the heart of cohen's criminal organization, even shutting down his lucrative wire gambling business. the squad breaks into cohen's mansion and keeler plants a bug in the back of a television. as a result, cohen believes someone has betrayed him and lashes out at those around him, including his etiquette tutor grace faraday. wooters and faraday have entered into a secret romantic relationship, and he tries to help her escape from cohen, enlisting the help of mutual friend and gangster jack whalen.
realizing the attackers have never stolen his money, cohen deduces they are cops and realizes that they have bugged his house. he uses it to lure the squad into an unsuccessful ambush in chinatown while keeler is executed by a hitman. when faraday witnesses cohen murder whalen, she agrees to testify against her former employer. o'mara forces the crooked honorable judge carter to sign an arrest warrant before leading the squad to the park plaza hotel to arrest cohen.
cohen and his men engage in a lengthy shootout with the squad; with wooters and kennard being wounded in the process. cohen and his bodyguard karl lennox escape, but o'mara rams their vehicle into a fountain. navidad helps a dying kennard shoot lennox, saving o'mara. cohen and o'mara fight each other in a brutal bareknuckle brawl while a crowd of onlookers and journalists gather. o'mara finally beats cohen and has him arrested, ending his reign over los angeles. the gangster squad is never mentioned for its role in keeping the mafia from gaining a lasting foothold in la, and its surviving members remain a secret. cohen is sentenced to life imprisonment and is greeted with a beating by inmates who were friends of whalen. wooters and faraday get married, and o'mara quits his job with the lapd to live a quiet life with his wife and son.

on review aggregator rotten tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 31% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. the website's critical consensus reads, "though it's stylish and features a talented cast, gangster squad suffers from lackluster writing, underdeveloped characters, and an excessive amount of violence." on metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "b+" on an a+ to f scale.the reviewers of spill.com gave it a "rental," praising the stylish approach but criticizing the dialogue, emma stone's under-developed "damsel-in-distress" character, and sean penn's laughable makeup. ign editor chris tilly wrote "gangster squad looks great but frustrates because with the talent involved, it had the potential to be so much more" and rated the film 6.3/10. richard roeper gave the film a b+, saying "gangster squad is a highly stylized, pulp-fiction period piece based on true events" and noted the strong performances.

== historical accuracy ==
the film is inspired by the real-life gangster squad of the lapd, although much of the film is fabricated.
the film portrays cohen organizing the murder of his overseer jack dragna, whereas in reality cohen and dragna were equals and dragna died of a heart attack in 1956.
the film shows cohen as moving into gambling in addition to prostitution and drug dealing. in reality, cohen's main racket was bookmaking; he detested drugs.
william parker was only 45 years old in 1949, and not in his 70s like nick nolte (parker did not live to become 70; he died at age 61), and was not the one who created the gangster squad. the squad was created by chief clemence b. horrall in 1946, and was in an effort to save the image of the city, not the actual city itself.
the film concludes with cohen being arrested in 1949 for murder and sent to alcatraz. in reality, he was imprisoned in 1951 and again in 1961 for tax evasion. he was, however, attacked with a lead pipe while in prison as mentioned.
while anthony mackie and michael pea are members of the squad in the film, the real life group had no african-american or hispanics as part of it.
while it is possible cohen murdered jack whalen in real life, it was not at whalen's home as depicted in the film. whalen was shot in 1959 while at dinner with cohen and three of his associates, although cohen was not accused or convicted of the murder himself.
cohen's bodyguard johnny stompanato was not shot like depicted in the film, but instead lived until 1958, when he was stabbed by cheryl crane, the daughter of his girlfriend, lana turner.
the character max kennard was based on real life lawman doug (jumbo) kennard, who was killed in a 1952 drunk car crash after he had retired, and not shot in the line of duty like in the film.
in the film, conwell keeler is the first member of the squad to be killed. in real life, he outlived all other members of the gangster squad, dying of a stroke in 2012.
