== plot ==
artist and graphics designer patience phillips is a meek people-pleaser whose main support is her best friend sally. she works for a cosmetics company called hedare beauty which is ready to ship a new skin cream called beau-line that is able to reverse the effects of aging. however, when patience visits the r&d laboratory facility to deliver a redone ad design, she overhears a discussion between scientist dr. ivan slavicky and laurel hedare, the wife of company-owner george hedare, about the dangerous side effects from continually using the product. laurel's guards discover patience and are ordered to dispose of her. patience tries to escape using a conduit pipe, but the minions have it sealed and flush her out of it, drowning her. washed up on shore, patience is mysteriously revived by an egyptian mau cat which had appeared at her apartment earlier; from that moment on, she develops cat-like abilities.
from mau's owner eccentric researcher ophelia powers, patience learns that egyptian mau cats serve as messengers of the goddess bast. patience realizes that she is now a "catwoman," reborn with abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. disguised as a mysterious vigilante named catwoman to hide her identity, patience, under cover of darkness, searches for answers as to who killed her and why. eventually, her search (which includes finding slavicky's body, and later being accused of his murder) leads her to laurel. she asks laurel to keep an eye on george, to which laurel agrees. however, when patience confronts george (who is attending an opera with another woman) as catwoman, he reveals he knows nothing about the side effects. the police, led by patience's love interest detective tom lone, arrive and catwoman escapes. later on, laurel murders george for his infidelity and admits to having dr. slavicky killed because he wanted to cancel the product's release. she contacts catwoman and frames her for the murder. tom then takes catwoman into custody, but not before laurel reveals the product's side-effects: discontinuing its use makes the skin disintegrate, while continuing its use makes the skin as hard as marble. she also plans to release beau-line to the public the following day.
patience slips out of her cell and confronts laurel in her office, rescuing tom, who came to question laurel after second thoughts about patience's guilt in the process, and revealing that laurel is the one responsible for her death. during the fight, she scratches laurel's face multiple times, causing laurel to fall out of a window and grab onto a pipe. laurel sees her face in a window's reflection and horrified by her skin's rapid disintegration (as a result of the scratches and her own use of beau-line for years), she fails to grab hold of patience's outstretched arm and falls to her death. though patience is cleared of any charges made against her regarding the deaths of dr. slavicky and the hedares, she decides to end things with tom by choosing to continue living outside the law and enjoying her newfound freedom as the mysterious catwoman.

=== development ===
with warner bros. moving on development for batman forever in june 1993, a catwoman spin-off film was announced. michelle pfeiffer was set to reprise her role from batman returns while tim burton became attached as director and producer denise di novi and writer daniel waters also returned. in january 1994, burton was unsure of his plans to direct catwoman or an adaptation of "the fall of the house of usher". on june 16, 1995, waters turned in his catwoman script to warner bros., the same day batman forever was released. burton was still being courted to direct. waters joked, "turning it in the day batman forever opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family batman. catwoman is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script." in an august 1995 interview, pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects.the film labored in development hell for years with ashley judd set to star as the lead as far back as 2001, but eventually dropped out of the role. nicole kidman was also considered for the role after judd stepped out of the project. when warner bros. canceled a batman vs. superman film scheduled for 2004, the studio decided to quickly produce catwoman as replacement, starring halle berry.
