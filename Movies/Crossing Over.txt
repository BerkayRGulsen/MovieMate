== production ==
crossing over was filmed on location in los angeles in 2007.the film originally featured a scene in which an iranian woman is murdered by her brother in an honor killing. following complaints that the plotline was unrealistic and offensive, the killing was presented as an intended beating which got out of hand, removing the dialogue referring to "honor" and "family honor".additionally, sean penn filmed scenes as an immigration cop. however, his scenes were cut due to the controversy over the honor killing plot, though producer harvey weinstein later claimed that penn's agent requested his scenes be cut out of the film.


== release ==
although the film was shot in 2007, it was not released until 2009, and even then only in a limited theatrical run. the film's original running length was 140 minutes, but the film's producer (who had final cut privilege) was convinced to edit the film down to 113 minutes when harvey weinstein threatened to release the film straight to dvd and bypass a theatrical release altogether. in many countries outside of the us, the film went straight to dvd anyway.
the film was distributed in the united states by mgm and the weinstein company. it was given a limited theatrical release on february 27, 2009, and ultimately grossed less than us$500,000 in north america, and just over us$2.5 million internationally. the film has reportedly made another us$1.7 million in u.s. dvd sales.


== reception ==
the film received generally negative reviews. review aggregator site rotten tomatoes reports that 16% of 106 critics gave the film a positive review, for an average rating of 4.1/10. the site's consensus reads that: "crossing over is flagrant and heavy-handed about a situation that deserves more deliberate treatment, and joins its characters with coincidences that strain believability." metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 38 based on reviews from 31 critics indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".
