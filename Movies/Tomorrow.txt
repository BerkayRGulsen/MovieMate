tomorrow is a 1972 american drama film directed by joseph anthony. the screenplay was written by horton foote, adapted from a play he wrote for playhouse 90 that was based on a 1940 short story by william faulkner in the short story collection knight's gambit.  the pg-rated film was filmed in the mississippi counties of alcorn and itawamba. although released in 1972, it saw limited runs in the u.s. until re-released about ten years later.
the opening courthouse scenes of tomorrow were shot at the historic jacinto courthouse in alcorn county, mississippi. the courthouse, built in 1854, has been refurbished and is listed in the national register of historic places. the majority of the film was shot in the bounds crossroads community of itawamba county, at the sawmill on the farm of chester russell, the grandfather of singer tammy wynette (virginia wynette pugh), who lived most of her young years there with her grandparents until she married in 1960. the sawmill building, where much of the film was shot, was built just for the film. chester russell played one of the jurors and can be seen when the jury is deliberating in the opening courthouse scenes. some of the film props were also leased from james franks antique museum of tupelo, mississippi. lead robert duvall, the only known surviving actor from the film, has called tomorrow one of his personal favorites.

=== critical reception ===
the film was praised by rex reed, gene shalit, archer winsten and jeffrey lyons, with reed stating that he believed it was the best depiction of faulkner ever screened. vincent canby of the new york times overall did not care for the film but acknowledged it was well-intentioned:[t]he horton foote screenplay is less an adaptation than an enlargement, in the playwright's dumbest, television-fake literary style of the 1950s. tomorrow is not one of faulkner's most interesting works... mr. foote's attempts at pretty po' fo'k dialogue come very close to the ludicrous... even if the movie's intentions are decent, as reflected in the accurate look of the production, filmed in mississippi, the effect is mostly patronizing.
in the annual leonard maltin's movie guide, the film was rated 3 stars, noting that "bellin is excellent. duvall astonishingly good in best-ever screen presentation of the author's work".
