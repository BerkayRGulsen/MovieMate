== plot ==
the film is a romantic comedy about a group of britons flying out from the london airport for a weekend in paris in 1953 in a british european airways airspeed ambassador. an english diplomat (sim) is on a working trip to obtain an agreement with his russian counterpart (illing); a royal marine bandsman (shiner) has a night out on the tiles after winning a pool of the french currency held by all the marines in his band; a young woman (bloom) finds romance with an older frenchman (dauphin) who gives her a tour of paris; an amateur artist (rutherford) searches out fellow painters on the left bank and in the louvre; a hearty englishman (edwards) spends the entire weekend in an english-style pub; and a battle of normandy veteran (copeland) is an archetypal scotsman in kilt and tam o' shanter who finds love with a young french woman (grard).
the film displays the mores and manners of the british, and, to a lesser extent, the french, in the early nineteen-fifties. at this time, britons were allowed to take only 25 out of the country, as 5 british cash and traveller's cheques, and there are several scenes showing how the travellers dealt with this. the film also features a russian nightclub (of which there were several in paris at the time), with ludmila lopato, a russian tzigane chanteuse, singing the original russian version of the song that became "those were the days", which became a hit record for mary hopkin.
