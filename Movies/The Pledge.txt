== plot ==
aging police detective jerry black (nicholson) attends a retirement party hosted by his department, at which captain pollack (shepherd) presents jerry tickets to a fishing trip in mexico as a gift. the celebration is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, ginny larsen. jerry decides to go with another detective, stan krolak (eckhart), to the scene of the crime.
jerry delivers the bad news to ginnys parents, and the mother, margaret larsen (patricia clarkson), makes jerry swear on a cross, made by their daughter, that he will find the killer. a suspect, toby jay wadenah (del toro), a native american man with mental retardation, is found the next day. stan uses tobys disorder to his advantage, convincing him that he killed ginny. after having confessed to doing so, toby steals a deputys gun and commits suicide. an autopsy on ginny proves that she had consumed chocolate before she died; wrappers found in tobys red truck solidify the likelihood that he killed the little girl, and the case is closed, despite jerrys suspicions. 
still adamant about his pledge to find the killer, jerry chooses not to go to mexico and misses his flight. instead, he visits ginnys grandmother, annalise hansen (vanessa redgrave), who tells him of the many stories that she and ginny used to read; one tells of an angel who descends from heaven in order to fly a deceased child over all the places they loved in life, before delivering them to god. jerry then visits one of ginnys friends, who reveals that she had made friends with a man she called "the giant" shortly before she was killed. jerry finds a picture ginny drew of "the giant", but it does not resemble toby, and features a black station wagon and not the red truck driven by toby. he takes the drawing with him.
jerry goes to stan and asks him to reopen the case. stan refuses but gets jerry more information about similar cases in the area. jerry's investigations reveal three local, unsolved cases that bear the same m.o. as seen with ginnys, and which toby could not have possibly committed because he was incarcerated at the time. jerry presents his research and ginny's drawing to captain pollack and stan, who are doubtful.
while fishing, jerry notices a gas station that is located near the center of the cases. after buying the station, jerry moves into the house behind it and meets local waitress/bartender lori (wright penn), and her daughter, chrissy. he takes an interest in chrissy and becomes friends with the small family. one night, lori shows up at jerry's house, bruised and battered, and explains that her ex (who has a restraining order) attacked her. jerry, out of concern for the their safety, suggests that lori and chrissy move in with him temporarily; she agrees. jerry slowly develops a fatherly relationship with chrissy, and even begins a romance with lori herself.
one day, local pastor gary jackson (noonan) visits chrissy outside the station. jerry suspects that jackson is ginny's killer after he invites chrissy to his church. jerry rushes to the church after jackson picks her up one day while he was fishing, but finds it was nothing more than a close-call, and that jackson is in reality not the killer. 
meanwhile, chrissy begins meeting with a man who drives a black car with a toy porcupine hanging on the rear mirror; porcupines were another aspect of ginny's drawing that have set jerry off. at night, while reading her a bed-time story, chrissy tells jerry that she met a 'wizard' who gave her porcupine candies and told her not to tell her parents of their correspondence. chrissy alerts jerry to a meeting that will happen between her and the wizard the next day. using chrissy as bait, jerry stages an operation with stan's help to catch the killer. however, as they await his arrival, the wizard dies in a car accident; hours later, stan gives up, and tell lori what happened. she confronts jerry angrily about putting chrissy in danger, and breaks up with him.
some time later, jerry sits alone on a bench in front of the ruined gas station. despondent, destitute, and drunk, jerry ends up all alone, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there, unaware that he is actually dead.

== production ==
the film was shot mainly on location in the british columbia interior. while the opening scenes were filmed in reno, nevada, the rest of the film was shot in keremeos, princeton, hedley, merritt and lytton, all in british columbia. tom noonan recounts that, when battlefield earth flopped, the film's backers "were so freaked out... that they got on sean [penn] about finishing on time and finishing under budget, which wasnt really possible, because they were shooting in the mountains, and there were four or five scenes that i still had to shoot, which they never shot, which explain who i am in that film. because im not the guy who killed the kids. im not the bad guy in the film." he has repeated this assertion, but without offering a reason as to why the film did present him as the villain: "theres another guy whos in a mercedes that gets burned at the end. and people tell me i look like the guy in the mercedes but thats not me. im the nice guy in that movie. at least in the script i am."
