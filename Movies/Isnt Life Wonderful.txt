"wonderful life" is a song by the english singer black from his 1986 album of the same name. it was released twice as a single and was successful the second time, becoming a top ten hit in austria, france, germany, italy, switzerland, the netherlands and the uk. black, who wrote the song while broke, commented: "i was really being ironic... most people took it at face value."


== single release ==
first released in 1986 by ugly man records, it initially peaked at no. 72 on the uk singles chart. the label and vearncombe then decided to re-release the song with a new record company, a&m records after the success of "sweetest smile" and the single reached a higher peak of no. 8 on the uk singles chart in august 1987.


== reception ==
in a contemporary review in smash hits, vici mcdonald called it a "wonderful record  sentimental without being slushy." she went on: "it's heartening to see someone who a) isn't particularly handsome, b) has a spook-name (i.e. colin vearncombe), c) has no discernible 'image' and d) writes slightly odd lyrics, get into the charts purely on the strength of their music, which in this case is very strong indeed."the song was described by allmusic as a "seductive, bittersweet ballad". the daily telegraph said, "its oddly uplifting lyrics... combined with black's melancholy croon created, as one critic observed, 'luxuriantly melodic pop that sounds something like a male version of sade'."


== music video ==
the music video, shot in black and white, was filmed around the english seaside resort of southport, merseyside, as well as wallasey near black's hometown of liverpool, and features new brighton lighthouse and promenade. the video includes the looping star rollercoaster, a ride at pleasureland at the time, as well as the galleon fairground ride, the shrimping boat, local shops and residents. it was directed by gerard de thame, husband of television presenter rachel de thame, and won an award at the new york film festival in 1988.
