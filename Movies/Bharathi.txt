== reception ==
malathi rangarajan of the hindu said, "the majestic gait, the intimidating, piercing eyes that sparkle with a mix of eccentricity, anger, defiance and passion  shayaji shinde is indeed a remarkable choice for the role of bharati." and "it is another fantastic break for devyani as chellamma, the wife of subramania bharati. her soft, vulnerable docility and her helpless effete submission to her husband's impractical way of life have been beautifully portrayed." rediff said, "sayaji shinde as bharati is simply splendid. his is an impressive performance, with nary an inkling of the trepidation that he is enacting bharati's role -- he, a maharashtrian and tamil, an alien tongue." thiraipadam.com said, "this is a good biography, but in the end, it seems like it's more a collection of stories than a continuous film. which is unfortunate because the film had great potential to be absolutely stunningly excellent."
