== plot ==
the film opens in a street in hyderabad in a night with krishna (vishnu manchu) saving sirisha (shanvi srivastava) from some eve-teasers and accompanying her to the hostel she stays. in the journey, they both come to know that they hail from the rayalaseema region of andhra pradesh. when sirisha asks krishna about the details of his father, the scene shifts to the native place of krishna where his father, a don fondly called as anna (mohan babu) and as annagaru with respect, punishing a teacher named sankar rao for harassing his pregnant wife for dowry on the complaint of the woman's father rama rao. anna is a sexagenarian man who always thinks about the welfare of the people of rayalaseema, and they too revere him equal to god. anna is a very powerful and influential don who also controls the political affairs of that region. his friend ananda rao (paruchuri gopala krishna), a ruling party politician, is his close friend, and he and the party extends their full support to anna to stop the nandavaram project whose happening would destroy 34 villages completely. on the other hand, a group of influential people working under a mysterious man tries to make the project to earn crores. the group consists of kr, vedantham murthy aka vedam (tanikella bharani), chandi (jeeva), and seshagiri, who is fond of cakes.
krishna visits his home when anna kills his opponent guruva reddy (banerjee) and appoints the dead man's henchmen as his henchmen by promising a little high salary. then the family of anna is introduced. anna is survived by his wife lakshmi (jayasudha), elder son bhushan (kishore) and krishna. bhushan is married and has a kid, but he never loved them and hates them to the core. unlike anna and his dutiful and devoted brother krishna, bhushan is a spoiled brat, often terrorizing people in the name of anna, creating fear in their hearts. when a young woman's brother warns bhushan, bhushan comes to their home, kidnaps the woman, and conducts a sexual assault on her in his farmhouse. bhushan, also because of his anger on his father apart from greed for money, joins hands with kr's group for the formation of the nandavaram project. meanwhile, krishna and sirisha are deeply in love, and anna's trusted henchmen ramudu finds out that she is gavarraju's daughter. gavarraju was anna's enemy who was killed by anna at tirupathi during an assassination attempt. though sirisha is aware of it, she has no objection to join his family, and anna too respects krishna's decision to marry her and accepts their alliance.
meanwhile, sirisha informs krishna in their regular meeting that her friend is kidnapped and kept in anna's farmhouse by bhushan, who trashed her brother recently. she also adds that none dared to convey the same to anna because of bhushan. krishna tells the whole matter to anna, and when he finds the woman assaulted there, he apologizes to her and tells ramudu to drop her in her home. he also house arrests bhushan there forever to ensure the safety of the innocent people. but on the request of lakshmi, he lets him enter his house again. later, ramulu invites anna and lakshmi for attending his daughter's wedding and they accept it happily. however, sirisha's brother reveals to krishna that anna is going to be fatally attacked in the way. at the time of execution, firing starts on anna's vehicles, and in this confusion, bhushan kills his wife and son, but none knows that. anna is severely injured and attacked by the rivals, who are killed by krishna. anna is sent to the nearby hospital. inspector gogin rao (ravi babu) asks anna's men to get out of the hospital as the patients and their relatives are frightened of seeing them carrying weapons. this results in a brawl between krishna and gogin rao, and the former is arrested for attacking a police officer on duty.
however, it is later revealed that gogin rao is not as sincere as he appears and works for kr. sirisha goes to the police station and tells krishna that anna is going to be attacked again by the rivals' men. krishna goes there and saves anna from the goons. later, as both the plans are failed, bhushan goes to the hospital carrying oranges to the hospital and leaves soon. he keeps explosives inside them so that anna dies because of a blast as suggested by kr and vedam. unfortunately, lakshmi cuts them, and the blast occurs. anna, who was in the way to the room conducting medical tests, collapses and understands what happened then. after lakshmi's funeral is conducted, krishna meets anna and tells that kr, gogin rao, chandi, vedam, seshagiri, and bhushan are the culprits and adds that he would kill all of them. first, he kills gogin rao by strangling him with a thin wire. next, he kills seshagiri by feeding him a poisoned (possibly cyanide-infused) cake. then, he kills chandi by locking him in a car filled with gas, leading to suffocation. vedam is murdered brutally and is hanged from a tree to resemble a suicide. kr is shot offscreen and dies when lit on fire by krishna. later, krishna meets bhushan, narrates bhushan's plans and deeds to bhushan himself, and when he feels guilty, krishna calls him a mad dog and shoots him.
finally, during lakshmi's last rites, the main one behind the group is revealed as ananda rao. his close associates hold more than 50% stake in the nandavaram project, and with that money, he planned to shift to the opposition party and win the elections. since anna would oppose it, he wanted to murder him and joins hands with kr and his group. on anna's request, krishna himself murders ananda rao. the film ends with anna conducting lakshmi's death rituals and krishna appointing ananda rao's gunmen as his henchmen promising a little higher salary like anna did in the case of guruva reddy.

== reception ==
the film received positive reviews from critics though they drew comparisons and similarities with ram gopal varma's sarkar. the hindu gave a review stating "the film is helped hugely by good performances from mohan babu, vishnu and jayasudha. while varma can be commended for channelising mohan babus aggression in an apt role, one wishes he hadnt made the actor say respect so many times that it becomes a joke. rowdy is one of the better films from varma is recent times but offers nothing new in content." oneindia entertainment gave a review stating "overall, ram gopal varma has taken the story from his sarkar and weaved a different screenplay for rowdy keeping telugu audience in mind. he has also added a few commercial ingredients to it. it is a good entertainer and will be a treat for action lovers. must watch the film for mohan babu fans" and rated the film 3/5. deccan chronicle gave a review stating "varmas films are always technically good and rowdy is no exception. the action sequences are well choreographed, especially the one where goons surround mohan babu. rgv, however, is still out of touch and most of the scenes and camera angles are mere repetitions of his earlier films. if you haven't seen sarkar, you can watch rowdy, especially for mohan babu's performance" and rated the film 2.5/5.123telugu.com gave a review stating "rowdy is an intense action thriller that makes for a good watch. if you have seen godfather, the impact may be a little less. the movie's appeal might be limited to a centers alone. watch the film for mohan babu" and rated the film 3.25/5. idlebrain.com gave a review stating "mohan babu is a superb actor. after m dharmaraju ma and rayalaseema ramanna chowdary, this is the most compelling character he has done in his career. it took a director of ram gopal varma calibre to present mohan babu in a natural avatar. plus points of the film are mohan babu, vishnu manchu, and their characterizations. on the flip side, a toned-down violence and a compelling second half would have made the movie more universal. on a whole, rowdy is a special film that adds a feather to the cap of mohan babu" and rated the film 3/5. indiaglitz gave a review stating "if you wanted to see mohan babu do an amitabh bachchan while retaining his irreverent style, 'rowdy' fulfills that urge. the discerning might lament it as a dumbed-down version of sarkar, though" and rated the film 3.25/5.
