on 1 december 2009, a press conference was held for the film, along with chan's announcement of a new teaser trailer posted on the film's official sina website. twitch also released a plot synopsis of the film:
it was the darkest of times in china, when ruthless warlords waged battles to satiate their endless aggression. millions of lives perished, and those who survived had only two choices  kill or be killed.
the battalions of warring states liang and wey collided in a bloodbath that lasted from dawn until dusk. only two men were left standing  a foot soldier from liang and the rival general from wey. the soldier survived because he is an expert in playing dead, with a device strapped on his body which protruded like an arrowhead for added realism.

the soldier captured the wounded general, hoping to use the enemy as his ticket to freedom  by handing the general to the liang warlord, the soldier could be honorably discharged and return home to his peaceful life. the young general, though taken captive, was condescending towards the soldier. the two men were often at loggerheads during the long and winding journey.
