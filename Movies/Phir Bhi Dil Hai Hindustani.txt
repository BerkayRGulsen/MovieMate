== plot ==
ajay bakshi (shahrukh khan) is a successful loudmouthed reporter, working for a reputed news channel. the rival news channel ropes in ria banerjee (juhi chawla) to bring him down. ria is the antithesis of ajay and uses her intelligence, charm and wits to get her work done.
pappu junior alias choti (johnny lever) is a don who is to be ousted from his own gang, owing to his inability to make it big in the crime world. ajay approaches choti with an offer: arrange a fake attack on minister ramakant dua's (shakti kapoor) brother-in-law madanlal gupta (mahavir shah), on national tv. choti will earn respect & ajay's channel will gain ratings. little does ajay know that the plan is going to turn too real.
ramakant dua's brother-in-law is gunned down by an assailant named mohan joshi (paresh rawal). minister ramakant takes advantage of his brother-in-law's death to gain votes and sympathy; he also instigates a pogrom to ensure his position in the government. ajay and ria start getting along as they work together to cover the city riots. mohan is arrested and to avoid public unrest, the police commissioner declares that mohan is a foreign terrorist. mohan escapes jail and hides in ajay and ria's car.
when mohan accosts them, ajay accuses him of being a terrorist. mohan yells that he is not and tells the two his story: mohan had a happy family with a wife (neena kulkarni) and daughter. one day, his daughter went for an interview and ramakant's brother-in-law raped and beat her. she died from the trauma and as no lawyer was willing to fight the case due to the perpetrator's political power, mohan was left helpless, running from door to door for justice. hence hopeless, he took the law into his own hands and killed the rapist.
ajay and ria decide to help mohan, who sees them as his own kids and helps them realize their love for each other. ajay hands over the videotape of mohan's confession to his boss and uncle kaka (satish shah). unfortunately, the minister has joined hands with rival minister mushran (govind namdeo) as he fears that their secrets might come out if mohan's truth is revealed. ajay's boss forms an alliance with ria's boss chinoy (dalip tahil). the ministers and channel heads come together and trick ajay and ria into giving them the tape.
when mohan is arrested and sentenced to be publicly hanged, ajay and ria realize they were tricked. they work together with choti to get the tape back. ajay succeeds in broadcasting mohan's confession just an hour before mohan's execution and tearfully requests the nation to stop this injustice.
the ministers and policemen try to prevent the protesters from entering the prison ground but the acp joins ajay and ria, thus neutralizing the police barricades. in a blatant mockery and critique of media's selfish obsession with ratings and views, mohan is made to wear a shirt sporting logos of sponsors and companies. seconds before the execution, ajay saves mohan and the protesters beat up the politicians and chase them out, ensuring their careers are over.
mohan's execution is called off and the film ends happily as ria proposes to ajay, who accepts.
