john ford's older brother francis proposed john to direct the film after the first director left. harry carey and john ford hit it off immediately and continued to work together after the success of the film. carey mentored ford "he tutored me in the early years sort of brought me along".most of the exterior sets were built and the film was shot on the universal backlot. ford concocted a scheme to make a feature length film out of what was budgeted to be a two reel film by telling universal some of the exposed film had fallen in a river. when universal realized that they had a full length film on their hands, the studio was upset. studio executive carl laemmle pointed out that, if he paid for a suit and got an extra pair of pants, he wouldnt just throw them away.
