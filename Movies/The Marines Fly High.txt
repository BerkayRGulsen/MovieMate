== production ==
principal photography for the marines fly high took place from late october to december 2, 1939, on rko sound stages. the backlots served as the locale for many of rko's features set in more exotic locations. the use of u.s. marine aircraft and the ability of both dix and morris to look comfortable as pilots led an air of authenticity to the programmer.


== reception ==
the marines fly high was a typical b movie whose action scenes received good notices from critics with frank s. nugent of the new york times in a contemporary review, noting the film was "... a comfortably agile adventure story." a more recent appraisal by reviewer frank miller likewise described the film as "crammed" with action.film historian richard jewell in the rko story (1982), characterized the screenplay in the marines fly high by jerry cady and lieutenant commander a.j. bolton as "dull" and "lacklustre".aviation film historian james h. farmer in celluloid wings: the impact of movies on aviation (1984) noted the marines fly high was puncuated by "the quick-paced roar of machine guns, rifles and airplane engines in this low-budget effort (that) fortunately leaves little time for a careful look at the lackluster plot."
