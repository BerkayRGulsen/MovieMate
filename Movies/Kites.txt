== reception ==


=== critical reception ===
the film received an 80% positive rating on the film critics aggregate site rotten tomatoes from 25 reviews, with the consensus being, "thoroughly overwrought in true bollywood fashion, kites is deeply flawed and too effervescently charming to resist." the movie generally received mixed reviews in india. it had a score of 5/10 on the critics aggregate site review gang, based on 13 reviews. the chemistry of the lead actors and the cinematography were specifically praised by indian critics anupama chopra and raja sen. rajeev masand of ibn said "thrilling action set-pieces, a super-fluid dance number to show off hrithik's killer moves, and repeated glimpses at the toned bodies of both lead stars. it's almost enough to forgive the uniformly bad acting of all supporting cast". anupama chopra of ndtv said "the film doesn't become more than the sum of its parts because the second half is flat and in places, outright foolish". noyon jyoti parasara of aol india stated, "it fails in the primary promise of a love story which surpasses language barriers," while shubhra gupta of indian express calls it "really old wine in a sort-of new bottle".in the u.s., jeannette catsoulis of the new york times called it "a lovers-on-the-lam blast of pure pulp escapism" that "caroms from car chase to shootout, from rain dancing to bank robbing with unflagging energy. it's all completely loony, but the stunts are impressive, the photography crisp and the leads so adorably besotted that audiences might as well check their cynicism at the door." frank lovece of film journal international said, "bollywood enters telenovela territory in a hybrid film that takes the heightened emotions, wild tonal ranges and impeccably crisp technique of modern hindi cinema and puts all that in the service of a tragic love story straight out of mexican tv. ... as an old-style hollywood romance in modern dress, it delivers what people say they want when they say, 'they don't make pictures like that anymore.'" kevin thomas of the los angeles times said the film "draws from westerns, musicals, film noir [and] chase thrillers with stunts so preposterous they verge on parody  and it gets away with everything because of [director] basu's visual bravura and unstinting passion and energy."

==== india ====
box office india said the film "opened to a bumper response at most places" in india, but noted "reports are not encouraging, the biggest reason for failure are being the film has a lot of english and spanish dialogue." the film collected 49.27 crore (us$10.78 million) net in its lifetime run in india.
