meanwhile, the doctor who treated chotta in the hospital comes to know from the news that chotta is a wanted terrorist and informs the police. the police collect the cctv footage from the hospital and the highway, which contained madhu and kulandai providing lifts to chotta. hence, they corner and arrest both of them. while being taken to custody, they are hit by a jeep and are injured, causing kulandai to forget his past. madhu thinks that kulandai must be a real associate of chotta and if he can make kulandai tell the police that madhu is not involved in this case, then he can escape. however, he is shocked to see kulandai having forgotten his past. the case is handled by dheena, who now gets a good chance to reject madhu, as he doubts that he is a terrorist. dheena plans to kill both of them in an encounter, but madhu and kulandai manage to escape. with help from bhargavi, they all hide in her friend's flat, which happens to be just below the flat in which chotta is hiding, in the same apartment. chotta plans his attack in two days and sends the bombs to his associates. he tells them that he will mention the locations one hour prior, using the draft communication.
madhu and bhargavi take kulandai to dr. thillai (m. s. baskar) and try to regain his memory using hypnotherapy. thillai successfully makes him regain his memory and he reveals that he too is innocent like madhu. madhu urges him to recall anything, while kulandai gave a lift to chotta. kulandai tells them that chotta made a phone call from the petrol bunk's public phone, and using lip reading, he manages to get the gmail username of chotta and his associates. however, he could not get the password, as chotta was turned the other side while saying that on the phone. with help from his friend in a telecom industry, madhu gets the number to which chotta made the call and tracks down the number to the same apartment in which they are currently staying at. he identifies chotta and manages to grab him, but chotta overpowers him and escapes. madhu chases chotta, but chotta gets away with his female associate escapes in a car. madhu throws his phone and manages to record a conversation between chotta and his female associate. chotta also delivers instructions to the bombers about the locations to be targeted via a draft from his gmail account.
