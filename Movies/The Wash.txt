sean (dr. dre) and dee loc (snoop dogg) are roommates who have not paid their rent, and their landlord's given them a 3-day eviction notice.
to make matters worse, sean has just lost his job at foot locker due to a layoff, so dee loc suggests his roommate stop by the same carwash where he works and apply for work there. sean is immediately hired as assistant manager, with chris (eminem) having been fired the day before. 
though dee loc has the full amount for the rent (from dealing drugs on the side), he refuses to pay, insisting sean needs to be responsible, and come up with his half. 
sean does his best to impress mr. washington (george wallace), the owner of the car wash, so he can hold his job long enough to come up with his half of the rent.
