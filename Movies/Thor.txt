thor is a 2011 american superhero film based on the marvel comics character of the same name. produced by marvel studios and distributed by paramount pictures, it is the fourth film in the marvel cinematic universe (mcu). it was directed by kenneth branagh, written by the writing team of ashley edward miller and zack stentz along with don payne, and stars chris hemsworth as the title character alongside natalie portman, tom hiddleston, stellan skarsgrd, colm feore, ray stevenson, idris elba, kat dennings, rene russo, and anthony hopkins. after reigniting a dormant war, thor is banished from asgard to earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer mjlnir. as his brother loki plots to take the asgardian throne, thor must prove himself worthy.
sam raimi first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on thor in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in "development hell" for several years. during this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until marvel signed mark protosevich to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through paramount. matthew vaughn was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. however, after vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. the main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in california and new mexico from january to may 2010. the film was converted to 3d in post-production.
thor premiered in sydney on april 17, 2011, and was released in the united states on may 6, as part of phase one of the mcu. the film was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide, and was positively reviewed for its performances but received criticism for some of its plot. two sequels have been released: thor: the dark world (2013) and thor: ragnarok (2017). a fourth film, thor: love and thunder, is in development.


== plot ==
in 965 ad, odin, king of asgard, wages war against the frost giants of jotunheim and their leader laufey, to prevent them from conquering the nine realms, starting with earth. the asgardian warriors defeat the frost giants in tnsberg, norway, and seize the source of their power, the casket of ancient winters.
in the present, odin's son thor prepares to ascend to the throne of asgard, but is interrupted when frost giants attempt to retrieve the casket. against odin's order, thor travels to jotunheim to confront laufey, accompanied by his brother loki, childhood friend sif and the warriors three: volstagg, fandral, and hogun. a battle ensues until odin intervenes to save the asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. for thor's arrogance, odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer mjlnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.
thor lands in new mexico, where astrophysicist dr. jane foster, her assistant darcy lewis, and mentor dr. erik selvig find him. the local populace finds mjolnir, which s.h.i.e.l.d. agent phil coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring foster's data about the wormhole that delivered thor to earth. thor, having discovered mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that s.h.i.e.l.d. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. with selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on earth as he develops a romance with foster.
loki discovers that he is laufey's biological son, adopted by odin after the war ended. loki confronts odin, who wearily falls into the deep "odinsleep" to recover his strength. loki takes the throne in odin's stead and offers laufey the chance to kill odin and retrieve the casket. sif and the warriors three, unhappy with loki's rule, attempt to return thor from exile, convincing heimdall, gatekeeper of the bifrstthe means of traveling between worldsto allow them passage to earth. aware of their plan, loki sends the destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton, to pursue them and kill thor. the warriors find thor, but the destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting thor to offer himself instead. struck by the destroyer and near death, thor proves himself worthy by his sacrifice to wield mjlnir. the hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the destroyer. kissing foster goodbye and vowing to return, he leaves with his fellow asgardians to confront loki.
in asgard, loki betrays and kills laufey, revealing his true plan to use laufey's attempt on odin's life as an excuse to destroy jotunheim with the bifrst bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. thor arrives and fights loki before destroying the bifrst bridge to stop loki's plan, stranding himself in asgard. odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when odin rejects his pleas for approval. thor makes amends with odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on earth, foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to asgard.
in a post-credits scene, selvig is taken to a s.h.i.e.l.d. facility, where nick fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object, which fury says may hold untold power. an invisible loki prompts selvig to agree, and he does.


== cast ==

chris hemsworth as thor: the crown prince of asgard, based on the norse mythological deity of the same name. director kenneth branagh and marvel studios chief kevin feige chose hemsworth after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was initially dropped from consideration and then given a second chance to read for the part. hemsworth stated that he gained 20 pounds (9 kg) for the role by eating non-stop and revealed that "it wasn't until thor that i started lifting weights, it was all pretty new to me." regarding his take on the character, hemsworth said, "we just kept trying to humanize it all, and keep it very real. look into all the research about the comic books that we could, but also bring it back to 'who is this guy as a person, and what's his relationship with people in the individual scenes?'" about approaching thor's fighting style, he remarked, "first, we looked at the comic books and the posturing, the way [thor] moves and fights, and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground. we talked about boxers, you know, mike tyson, very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier." dakota goyo portrays a young thor.
natalie portman as jane foster: a scientist and thor's love interest. marvel studios stated in an announcement that the character was updated from the comics' initial portrayal for the feature adaptation. when asked why she took the role, portman replied, "i just thought it sounded like a weird idea because kenneth branagh's directing it, so i was just like, 'kenneth branagh doing thor is super-weird, i've gotta do it.'" portman stated that she really wanted to do a big effects film that emphasized character, and getting to do it with branagh was a new way of approaching it, relative to star wars. regarding her preparation for the role portman remarked, "i signed on to do it before there was a script. and ken, who's amazing, who is so incredible, was like, 'you can really help create this character'. i got to read all of these biographies of female scientists like rosalind franklin who actually discovered the dna double helix but didn't get the credit for it. the struggles they had and the way that they thought  i was like, 'what a great opportunity, in a very big movie that is going to be seen by a lot of people, to have a woman as a scientist'. she's a very serious scientist. because in the comic she's a nurse and now they made her an astrophysicist. really, i know it sounds silly, but it is those little things that makes girls think it's possible. it doesn't give them a [role] model of 'oh, i just have to dress cute in movies'".
tom hiddleston as loki: thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the deity of the same name. hiddleston was chosen after previously working with branagh on ivanov and wallander. initially, hiddleston auditioned to play thor but branagh decided his talent would be better harnessed playing loki. hiddleston stated that the character was "a comic book version of edmund in king lear, but nastier." hiddleston had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because branagh wanted "loki to have a lean and hungry look, like cassius in julius caesar. physically, he can't be posing as thor". hiddleston looked at peter o'toole as inspiration for loki as well, explaining, "interestingly enough, [kenneth branagh] said to look at peter o'toole in two specific films, the lion in winter and lawrence of arabia. what's interesting about ... his performance [as king henry] is you see how damaged he is. there's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. he's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. what we wanted was that emotional volatility. it's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as o'toole head for those great high hills". ted allpress portrays a young loki.
stellan skarsgrd as erik selvig: a scientist doing research in new mexico who encounters thor. skarsgrd stated that he was not initially familiar with the comic book version of thor. as to why he took the part, skarsgrd remarked, i "chose thor because of [director] kenneth branagh. the script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. so i had a very happy time on it. what i always try to do is immediately do something i just haven't done so i get variation in my life. i've made about 90 films and if i did the same thing over and over again i would be bored by now. i try to pick different films, i go and do those big ones and having done that i can usually afford to go and do some really small obscure films and experiment a little".
colm feore as laufey: king of the frost giants and loki's biological father, based on the mythological being of the same name, who in myth was actually loki's mother. feore stated it took five hours for his makeup to be applied. about his character, feore remarked, "i am the king of frost giants. and if you've seen any of the frost giants, you know that i am, of course, the napoleon of frost giants. we've got some massive, fabulous guys who dwarf me and come in at around eight-and-a-half feet, nine feet. but, no. can't you tell by the commanding presence? i am the boss". he said the shakespearean training he shared with hopkins and director branagh helped keep production moving briskly, saying that "during the breaks, tony, myself and ken would be talking in shakespearean shorthand about what the characters were doing, what we thought they may be like, and how we could focus our attention more intelligently. these were discussions that took no more than a few minutes between takes, but they allowed ken, tony and [me] to understand each other instantly without ken taking an hour away to explain to the actors exactly what was going on. so that was enormously helpful."
ray stevenson as volstagg: a member of the warriors three, a group of three asgardian adventurers who are among thor's closest comrades, known for both his hearty appetite and wide girth. stevenson previously worked with kenneth branagh in the 1998 film the theory of flight, and with marvel studios as the titular character in punisher: war zone. stevenson wore a fat suit for the role, stating, "i've tried the suit on, and what they've done is kind of sex him up: he's sort of slimmer but rounder.". stevenson said, "he's got every bit of that falstaffian verve and vigor, and a bit of a beer gut to suggest that enormous appetite, but he's not the sort of weeble-shaped figure he is in the comics. he's falstaff with muscles. i've got this amazing foam-injected undersuit that flexes with me."
idris elba as heimdall: the all-seeing, all-hearing asgardian sentry of the bifrst bridge, based on the mythological deity of the same name. elba said branagh's involvement was a major incentive to take the role: "[branagh] called me up personally and said, 'i know this isn't a big role, but i would really love to see you play it.' it's kenneth branagh. i was like, 'definitely'". about the role elba remarked, "i did green screen for the first time! i wouldn't like to do a whole movie of green screen, though. you kind of forget the plot a littlelike being in a broadway play and doing it over and over and forgetting your line halfway through". elba stated he has made a four-picture commitment with marvel studios. elba's casting prompted a proposed boycott by the council of conservative citizens and a debate amongst comic book fans, some insisting it was wrong for a black man to play a nordic god. in response elba called the debate "ridiculous".
kat dennings as darcy lewis: a political science major who is jane foster's intern. dennings described her character as foster's "little helper gnome". dennings stated that her role was expanded during the rehearsal process. dennings explained, "she's kind of like a cute, clueless, little puppy or maybe a hamster. there wasn't much on the page for the darcy role to begin with and i didn't even see a script before i took the job so i didn't really know who darcy was at first. but she really evolvedshe's so much fun now even. she's very scooby-doo if that makes sense. she's always three steps behind and reacting to what's happening with these great expressions ... she gets things wrong and doesn't care."
rene russo as frigga: the wife of odin, queen of asgard, mother of thor, and adoptive mother of loki, based on the mythological deity of the same name. russo stated in march 2011 interview that she has signed on for possible sequels, although she stated that "who knows how many i'll do".
anthony hopkins as odin: the ruler of asgard, father of thor, and adoptive father of loki, based on the mythological deity of the same name. in an interview hopkins stated he knew nothing of the comic. about the film he said, "it's a superhero movie, but with a bit of shakespeare thrown in". hopkins stated, "i'm very interested in that relationship between fathers and sons", and that, "my father's relationship with me was cold. he was a hot-blood character but to me, cold. when i was young, he expressed his disappointment because i was bad in school and all of that. he didn't mean any harm, but i felt i could never meet up to his expectations." hopkins expressed that he found a personal resonance in the odin role, saying, "he's a stern man. he's a man with purpose. i play the god who banishes his son from the kingdom of asgard because he screwed up. he's a hot-headed, temperamental young man... probably a chip off of the old block but i decide he's not really ready to rule the future kingdom, so i banish him. i'm harsh and my wife complains and i say, 'that is why i'm king.' he's ruthless, take-it-or-leave-it. women are much more forgiving; men are not so forgiving. i know in my life, my karma is, 'if you don't like it, tough, move on.' and i move on. i'm a little like odin myself". in may 2016, mel gibson stated he was approached about the role but "didn't do it".
tadanobu asano as hogun: a member of the warriors three, primarily identified by his grim demeanor and as the only member who is not an sir. ray stevenson said of asano's character, "he doesn't speak much but when he does, everybody shuts up. but also in the healing room where everyone licks their wounds, he's the guy who just goes about his business".
josh dallas as fandral: a member of the warriors three, characterized as an irrepressible swashbuckler and romantic. stuart townsend was initially cast after zachary levi was forced to vacate the role due to a scheduling conflict. however, days before filming began, townsend was replaced by dallas citing "creative differences". dallas said he believed that fandral "would like to think of himself a philanderer. he would like to think of himself, i was saying, as the r. kelly of asgard. he's a lover, not a fighter". dallas mentioned that errol flynn was an inspiration for the character stating, "he was a big inspiration for the character and for me. i watched a lot of his movies and kind of got that into my bones. i tried to bring out that little bit of flynn-ness in it. flynn had a lot of that boyish charm that fandral's got...."
jaimie alexander as sif: a warrior and thor's childhood friend, based on the mythological deity of the same name. alexander was best known for her portrayal of jessi xx on the abc family series kyle xy. alexander said that she was familiar with marvel comics before having taken the part, having grown up with four brothers. alexander said the part required hours a day in the gym, though training is not unfamiliar to her, explaining she was one of few girls on her colleyville, texas, high-school wrestling team. alexander described her character as "one of the guys" and that, "she's a very talented, skilled warrior and can stand on her own against any villain in the film". about her relationship with thor she stated, "she is very loyal to thor and cares a lot about protecting him and protecting asgard".additionally, clark gregg reprises his role as s.h.i.e.l.d. agent phil coulson from the iron man films. maximiliano hernndez appears as s.h.i.e.l.d. agent jasper sitwell, adriana barraza plays diner owner isabella alvarez and isaac kappy plays a pet store clerk. joseph gatt, joshua cox, and douglas tait portray frost giants. stan lee and j. michael straczynski have cameo appearances as pick-up truck drivers, walter simonson has a cameo appearance as one of the guests at a large asgardian banquet, and samuel l. jackson and jeremy renner have uncredited cameos as nick fury and clint barton, respectively.

=== development ===

sam raimi originally envisioned the idea for thor after making darkman (1990); he met stan lee and pitched the concept to 20th century fox, but they did not understand it. thor was abandoned until april 1997, when marvel studios was beginning to expand rapidly. the film gained momentum after the success of x-men (2000). the plan was for thor to be made for television. upn was in talks for airing it; excited by the prospect, they pushed for a script and approached tyler mane to play thor. in may 2000, marvel studios brought artisan entertainment to help finance it as a film, but by june 2004 the project still had yet to be patronized by a studio. sony pictures entertainment finally purchased the film rights, and in december 2004 david s. goyer was in negotiations to write and direct. by 2005, though there were talks between goyer and marvel, goyer was no longer interested, though at this point the film was still set to be distributed through sony pictures.mark protosevich, a fan of the thor comic book, agreed to write the script in april 2006, and the project moved to paramount pictures, after it acquired the rights from sony. that year the film was announced to be a marvel studios production. in december 2007, protosevich described his plans for it "to be like a superhero origin story, but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential. it's the story of an old testament god who becomes a new testament god". in august 2007 marvel studios signed matthew vaughn to direct the film. vaughn then rewrote protosevich's script in order to bring down the budget to $150 million, as protosevich's first draft would have cost $300 million to produce. after the success of iron man, marvel studios announced that they intended to release thor on june 4, 2010, with iron man 2 being used to introduce the character of thor.


=== pre-production ===

vaughn was released when his holding deal expired in may 2008, at which point marvel set protosevich to work on a new draft and began searching for a new director. guillermo del toro entered talks to direct the film. del toro was a fan of jack kirby's work on the comics, and said that he loved the character of loki, but wished to incorporate more of the original norse mythology into the film, including a "really dingy valhalla, [with] vikings and mud". however, del toro ultimately turned down thor to direct the hobbit. by september 2008 d. j. caruso had been discussing taking on the project, though he did not read the script. later that month, kenneth branagh entered into negotiations to direct, and by december 2008, branagh confirmed that he had been hired. he described it as "a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario." branagh stated that he hoped to begin filming in january 2010, and marvel studios set back the release date of the film from its scheduled july 16, 2010 date to june 17, 2011, almost a full year later. they later moved the release date to may 20, 2011, to distance the film's release from that of captain america: the first avenger, another marvel studios film that was scheduled to be released on july 22, 2011. in october 2008, daniel craig was offered the role, but ultimately turned it down, citing his commitments to the james bond franchise.in february 2009, samuel l. jackson, who had briefly portrayed nick fury at the end of the film iron man, signed on to reprise the role in thor as part of an unprecedented nine-picture deal with marvel studios. in the same month, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of thor. however, in an april 2010 interview, jackson stated that he would not be appearing in thor. when asked why not jackson explained, "i have no idea. i'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. i thought i was; they said i was in the trades, and i was like, 'ooh! i got a job!' i called my agent he said, 'naw, you're not in it.' i was like, 'well shit, they need to pay me if they're gonna put my name in it.'" later in the month, jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for thor to serve as "connective tissue" for the avengers.in may 2009, chris hemsworth was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. hemsworth's brother, liam also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by marvel studios head kevin feige. kevin mckidd had also been considered for the role. the next day, marvel announced that tom hiddleston, who had worked with branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as loki. in june 2009, feige confirmed that both hemsworth and hiddleston had signed on. feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day earth and asgard but thor's human host, dr. donald blake, would not be included. in july 2009, marvel announced that natalie portman would portray jane foster. jaimie alexander and colm feore were reported to have joined the cast in september, with alexander portraying sif and feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain. in an interview with swedish news site ystads allehanda, stellan skarsgrd stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role. by late october anthony hopkins had been cast as odin in the film. the following month, marvel announced that they had cast the warriors three; fandral was to be played by stuart townsend, hogun was to be played by tadanobu asano and volstagg was to be played by ray stevenson. idris elba was announced to have joined the cast, portraying heimdall. natalie portman revealed that kat dennings would be involved in the project, portraying darcy, a coworker of portman's jane foster.in december 2009, rene russo was cast as frigga, thor's mother and odin's wife. later that month, actors joseph gatt, troy brenna, and joshua cox had been cast in the film, though none of their roles were revealed. in january 2010, adriana barraza had joined the film's cast, in a supporting capacity. only days before filming began, stuart townsend was replaced by joshua dallas as fandral, citing "creative differences". when spider-man 4's production stalled, paramount and marvel entertainment pushed up the release of thor by two weeks to may 6, 2011.the science & entertainment exchange introduced marvel entertainment, kenneth branagh, "the screenwriter, and a few people on the design and production side of things" to three physicists (sean carroll, kevin hand, and jim hartle), as well as physics student kevin hickerson, to provide a realistic science background for the thor universe. the consultation resulted in a change in jane foster's profession, from nurse to particle physicist, and the terminology (einstein-rosen bridge) to describe the bifrost bridge.


=== filming ===

in october 2008, marvel studios signed a long-term lease agreement with raleigh studios to photograph their next four filmsiron man 2, thor, captain america: the first avenger and the avengersat raleigh's manhattan beach, california facility. production weekly reported that filming on marvel's thor was scheduled to begin in los angeles mid-january, then move to santa fe, new mexico from march until late-april. principal photography began on january 11, 2010. a few days after filming began, clark gregg signed on to reprise his role from iron man and iron man 2 as agent coulson. in february, paramount pictures entered negotiations with del mar, california to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for thor involving six horses running down the terrain. paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film. on march 15, 2010, production of thor moved to galisteo, new mexico where cerro pelon ranch, an old-fashioned western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.branagh, a fan of the comic book since childhood, commented on the challenge of bridging asgard and the modern world: "inspired by the comic book world both pictorially and compositionally at once, we've tried to find a way to make a virtue and a celebration of the distinction between the worlds that exist in the film but absolutely make them live in the same world. it's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds. if it succeeds, it will mark this film as different.... the combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, i think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film".by april, the prospect for filming parts of thor in del mar, california had fallen through. paramount pictures sent a letter informing the city that it has instead chosen an undisclosed northern california location to film a beachfront scene for the film. the letter cited cost concerns with moving production too far away from its headquarters. filming wrapped on may 6, 2010.


=== post-production ===

in october 2010, casting calls revealed the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots. in march 2011, scenes involving adriana barraza were removed from the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with barraza again in the future. in response barraza stated, "it saddens me because the movie is great and because i was acting alongside some tremendous actors that i admire very much, but i understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut". barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. in that same month, douglas tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the frost giants. on his hiring, tait said "i am 6'5" and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7" and taller, and weighed over 250 pounds (110 kg). when the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. they auditioned people again and kenneth branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the frost giants". in april 2011, the imax corporation, paramount pictures and marvel entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in imax 3d, continuing the partnership which began on iron man 2. branagh stated that the 3-d process initially made him cringe but said "we came to feel that in our case 3-d could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience". although the film was shot in 2d, feige stated that the "special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3d". the post-credits scene that sees nick fury approach erik selvig to ask him to study the tesseract, was directed by the avengers's director, joss whedon.buf compagnie served as the lead visual effects vendor working on the film, with digital domain also providing work on the film. some of the software used for the visual effects were autodesk softimage. branagh stated that buf, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by hubble photography and other images of deep space. branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by j. m. w. turner to digital domain when creating jotunheim. peter butterworth, vfx supervisor and co-founder of fuel vfx, said the most challenging task was interpreting what the bifrst would look like, "you can't google what these things look likethey are totally imagined and within the heads of the stakeholders. so to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the bifrst and odin's chamber shots. part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo. in the film, odin enters what is known as the "odinsleep" in his chamber to regenerate. butterworth stated, "for odin's chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over odin's bed. this dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. we took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space".


== music ==

the film's score was written by composer patrick doyle, a frequent collaborator of branagh. doyle described thor as "the most commercially high profile film i have done since frankenstein", adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of asgard and earth. thus doyle and branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction, with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and "grand images [that] were not in any way hyperbolized", and the composer in turn implementing "a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work". as doyle declared that his own celtic background made him familiar with norse mythology, an old celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for thor's leitmotif. a soundtrack album was released by buena vista records in april 2011.the film also features a song by the foo fighters, "walk", in both a scene where a powerless thor shares some boilermakers with selvig in a roadhouse, and the film's closing credits. marvel president kevin feige stated that "walk" was a last minute addition, that the crew felt had "these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes" upon hearing it. branagh in particular thought that "these lyrics about learning to walk again" were appropriate "of [a] movie about redemption, learning to be a hero."


== marketing ==

in july 2010 marvel studios held a thor panel at the 2010 san diego comic-con international during which kenneth branagh, chris hemsworth, natalie portman, kat dennings, tom hiddleston, and clark gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it. a few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet. the first television advertisement was broadcast during super bowl xlv on the fox network in the united states. the rate for advertising during the game was approximately $3 million per 30-second spot. marvel studios and acura launched a joint viral marketing promotion at the 2011 chicago comic & entertainment expo. other official promotional partners included burger king, dr. pepper, 7 eleven, and visa. in may 2011 marvel entertainment's president of print, animation and digital, dan buckley, and marvel comics editor-in-chief, axel alonso, rang the nyse closing bell in celebration of the theatrical release of thor.a post-credits scene in the film iron man 2 showed coulson reporting the discovery of a large hammer in the desert. rick marshall of mtv news believed it to be the weapon mjllnir belonging to thor, writing, "it continues the grand tradition of connecting the film to another property in development around the marvel movie universe." in the commentary track of iron man 2' home media, iron man 2's director, jon favreau, stated that "this is a scene from [the set of] thor ".marvel animation announced a 26-episode animated series in november 2008, to air in late 2010 before the release of marvel studios' film. the company released an animated direct-to-video film, thor: tales of asgard, to coincide with the live-action film.a video game titled thor: god of thunder based on the film was developed by sega using the voices and likenesses of actors chris hemsworth, tom hiddleston and jaimie alexander, and was released on may 3, 2011.
