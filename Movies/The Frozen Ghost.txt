the group was formed out of the ashes of the band, sheriff, who had disbanded after an (at that point) unsuccessful run on the music charts.  sheriff rhythm guitarist/keyboardist arnold lanni and bassist wolf hassel decided to form a new group, and frozen ghost was born.
on their first two albums, frzen ghst and nice place to visit, the band were originally a studio duo, with lanni singing lead vocals and playing all the guitar and keyboard parts, in addition to being credited as the sole songwriter, while hassel played bass. their first two albums featured guest musicians, such as derry grehan, lead guitarist of honeymoon suite. on their final album shake your spirit, there were three official additions to the band: john bouvette, who was on drums and percussion, sammy de bartel on keyboards and phil x who played the guitar and did some vocals.  phil x was also credited on the album nice place to visit for being a guitarist, but was not considered an official band member until the final album was released.
frzen ghst disbanded in 1993, following their final album shake your spirit.
lanni would go on to become a successful producer for acts such as our lady peace, finger eleven and thousand foot krutch.  hassel would resurface in 1996 with the band, erin cody and the drum and later appeared on a 2003 album by toronto-based blues musician brian gladstone.hassel rejoined his former sheriff bandmates, freddy curci and steve demarchi on december 30, 2011 for an onstage performance by curci and demarchi's post-sheriff band, alias, which ultimately led to his joining alias as a permanent member in 2014.
