seventeen-year-old jimmy wallace panics after he thinks he has committed manslaughter while fighting with a group of teenage hoodlums. wallace then takes a random man and woman, and the woman's infant, hostage inside a food shelter outside a popular local restaurant, and threatens them if they try to escape. this leads to a stand-off with a police force led by the sympathetic detective, lieutenant porter, who tries to avoid bloodshed. meanwhile, an eager crowd of onlookers and a news reporter gather outside to see what will happen next.

corman later claimed the film was the first movie he produced which did not make money, although he said it earned its costs back off television rights. he also says he was out of the country during pre-production and much of the script was changed by the producer. corman returned to hollywood two days before filming began and tried to reverse the changes, but was only partially successful.
