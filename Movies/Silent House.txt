== plot ==
a young woman named sarah is staying at her family's dilapidated victorian house in the countryside with her father john and her uncle peter, helping them fix it to be put up for sale. after a petty argument between john and peter, peter leaves and drives into town for extra tools. sarah meets a young woman named sophia at the front door. sophia claims to be one of sarah's childhood friends, though sarah does not remember her.
soon after, sarah panics when she hears john falling down the stairs. she tries to leave the house but all exits are blocked, and she hides from an unknown perpetrator. she finds john unconscious with a head wound and runs to the basement in search of the cellar door that leads outside. she finds a bed and other evidence that someone else has been living there, possibly squatters. she sees a figure searching for her and escapes out the cellar door.
outside, she meets peter, who has returned, and sees a young girl on the road who disappears. peter and sarah discover john's body missing in the house. when the power is cut off, the only light source available to them is the flash on a polaroid camera. through a series of camera flashes, sarah sees the young girl and a man in the room. the power returns to reveal peter missing. sarah hides while two men take pictures, presumably pedophilic in nature, of an unseen girl. sarah tries to shoot one of the men with peter's gun, then hides in her room and begins to show signs of paranoia and psychosis. she experiences hallucinations of traumatic childhood events, including a bloodstain on the bed and the young girl in the bathtub with beer bottles and bloody water.
frightened, sarah flees and runs into sophia. john, now conscious, is wrapped in plastic and sitting in the living room. sophia gives sarah a key to a box containing pedophilic pictures of sarah as a little girl, implying that john sexually abused her. it is suggested that her recent interactions and hallucinations with the little girl and mystery attacker have been a traumatic repressed memory. events at the house have caused this memory to reappear, and sarah is now exacting her revenge. she has been confusing the events of her childhood with what she is doing now, likely due to dissociative identity disorder. she assaults john and peter in her "intruder" mode while simultaneously wandering the house as a victim trying to escape.
the "intruder" drags peter into the living room before it is revealed that it's actually sarah herself. sophia also turns out to be a figment of her imagination. john convinces sarah to untie him, then whips her with his belt. peter tries to stop him but john mocks peter's pleas. as his back is turned, sarah bludgeons his head with a sledgehammer, killing him. peter begs for mercy and tells her he should have stopped the rape and abuse from the hands of john. sarah leaves him and walks out silently.

== production ==


=== development ===
the script for the film was written by laura lau, and based on the uruguayan film la casa muda (2010). according to lau, she saw the original film twice and wrote the script for the remake based on the viewings rather than adapting it from paper. the script ultimately came out to around fifty-five to sixty pages, which left the filmmakers concerned as to whether or not the timing would translate during filming: "we wondered whether it would time out properly, because there are no cuts," said lau. "theres no way to fix anything in post, it has to pace perfectly when you shoot it. so i think that was a huge challenge in terms of writing the script." upon acquiring the house used for filming, lau re-wrote the script in order for it to be compatible with the restrictions and characteristics of the house.in terms of the film's unique presentation (being presented as a single take following one character), lau said: "this entire movie is this woman's experience; it is her reality [...] it is one character's point of view, it's exactly what she's experiencing." she also stated that several aspects of the film were purposefully left open for interpretation. while writing the script for the film, lau did extensive research on childhood sexual abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder stemming from psychological trauma.although the film's marketing campaign (as well as the promotion for the original film la casa muda) states that it is inspired by actual events, the specific events are not entirely known. according to lau, she and kentis were told, when approached to make the film, that it was based on an occurrence in uruguay, though the details were left ambiguous:

when we were approached to do the remake, the first thing that we were told, aside from the fact that it was a single take, was that it was based on a true story, and that the true story had to do with something that happened in a village in uruguay like, 60 years ago, where there were dead bodies and incest was involved.
in terms of casting, kentis and lau sought an actress with theatrical training due to the demanding nature of the filming process; elizabeth olsen was cast as the lead after impressing kentis and lau with her audition.


=== filming ===
the movie was shot with canon eos 5d mark ii cameras between october and november 2010 on location at a house in new rochelle, new york. the house used in the film was found by directors kentis and lau entirely empty, and was wallpapered and filled with props and furniture by the production design.due to the unique nature of the film's presentation as a single take, the production crew ran into several technical issues while filming, mainly surrounding lighting issues and mobility around the house. since filming was carried out in 12-15 minute takes, there were several occurrences where entire sequences had to be thrown out and re-done repeatedly due to lighting problems or missed cues.although the promotional material for the film suggests that it was filmed in real time in a single long take, elizabeth olsen revealed that the movie was actually filmed in 12-minute takes and edited so as to appear as one, which was later confirmed by kentis and lau.directors kentis and lau stated that they were inspired by alfred hitchcock's rope (1948) and russian ark (2002), both purported single take films, as well as the home invasion thriller the strangers (2008). due to the unconventional filming process and storytelling mode, kentis felt he was making an "experimental film." he also stated that the presentation and storytelling mode of the film as a single take was the main focus of the production, and that the fact that there were cuts in the film was irrelevant.

the world premiere of the film was at the 2011 sundance film festival, as part of the "park city at midnight" program; kentis, lau, and olsen also appeared. it was released theatrically in the united states on march 9, 2012.
