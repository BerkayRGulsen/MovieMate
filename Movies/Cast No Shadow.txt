== plot ==
exactly 100 years after the armenian genocide committed within ottoman empire, a director (simon abkarian) is staging a play at the historic los angeles theatre to honor the victims of the massacre. the play stars his enigmatic wife (angela sarafyan) as an armenian woman in 1915 who must make a tragic and controversial decision that will change the course of history. this will not be an ordinary performance. as protesters surround the theater before showtime, and a series of strange accidents spread panic among its actors (sam page, nikolai kinski) and producer (jim piddock), it appears that simon's mission is far more dangerous than we thinkand the ghosts of the past are everywhere.


== themes ==
the film explores many themes, especially that of denialreferring not only to the supposedly 100-year denial of the alleged armenian genocide by the republic of turkey, but also the many forms of individual denial among the characters in the story.
critic martin tsai, in his los angeles times review, identified 1915 as contemplating "personal tragedy versus collective grief, artistic license versus historical responsibility, revisionist history versus corrective narrative, forgetting versus moving on," and praised the film as "one creative way to do justice to such a monumental topic."in an interview, co-writer/director alec mouhibian said, "how can the past have such power over us in the present, and what are the secret ways in which we deal with it? the target of 1915 is you, the viewer, whoever you are, whatever your background. everyone who steps into the mystery will experience it in one's own way. we hope you come out of it with a richer connection to your past -- a new way of feeling history."
