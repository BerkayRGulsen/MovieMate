jam hsiao was handpicked by donnie yen for the mandarin theme song. the cantonese version was performed by hong kong singer and actor julian cheung.


== reception ==
the hollywood reporter writes "plagued by all manner of production snafus and a ballooning budget, the problems show in the final product. iceman is a fractured and often baffling martial epic that not even popular star donnie yen is likely to be able to save." screendaily writes the film is "beset by multiple problems, from a patchy incoherent script, to jarring shifts in tone and genre, and sub-par action and effects sequences that even the star presence of donnie yen may find hard to reconcile." donnie yen's performance won him the golden broom award for worst actor.
