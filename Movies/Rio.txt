== plot ==
in brazil, various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. in moose lake, minnesota, a crate with a male spix's macaw hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named linda gunderson, who names him blu. over the next 15 years, linda comes to own a bookstore. highly tame and unable to fly because he is scared to, blu is ridiculed frequently by the canada geese that come by outside of linda's bookstore because of this. one day, in late winter, ornithologist tlio monteiro invites blu and linda to rio de janeiro because blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known female macaw. linda initially refuses, but later accepts and they fly to rio. at tlio's aviary, blu meets jewel, a fiercely independent spix's macaw female longing to flee back to the wilderness. the macaws are captured by fernando, an orphaned boy, and a sulphur-crested cockatoo named nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding blu and jewel. 
while fernando has second thoughts about his actions, nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on "pretty birds" after a parakeet replaced his role on a television show. because of blu's familiarity with cages, he is able to escape with jewel and flee into the jungle. fernando meets linda and tlio and helps them find the birds, while blu and jewel meet rafael, a toco toucan, who offers to take them to his bulldog friend, luiz, to remove the leg cuffs holding them together. rafael attempts to teach blu how to fly before they meet up with a red-crested cardinal named pedro and his yellow canary friend nico. meanwhile, nigel coerces a horde of thieving marmosets led by mauro to capture blu and jewel. pedro and nico then take the macaws to a samba dance party, where they dance together and begin to fall in love, until the marmosets crash the party. the birds fight them off while the five escape on a tram.
fernando takes linda and tlio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover the birds have already been moved out and that the smugglers are planning to use the rio carnival parade to take the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been closed off for the festivities. meanwhile, blu and the others meet luiz, who is able to break the chain holding blu and jewel together. after the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.
pedro and nico then witness nigel capturing jewel. when blu and rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. meanwhile, linda and tlio have spotted the smugglers' parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. as linda and tlio pose as dancers in spix's macaw costumes, nigel captures blu and the group. linda and tlio fail to stop the smugglers in time as they take off in a short sc.7 skyvan. during the flight, blu breaks out his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. however, nigel attacks the macaws, injuring jewel's wing in the process. blu sends nigel flying into one of the plane's propellers with the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to begin to fall. the smugglers flee the plane while jewel falls out of the open cargo hatch towards the ocean. jumping out of the plane to rescue her, blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and jewel kiss, and he carries her to linda and tlio for help.
later, linda and tlio adopt fernando and live in the jungle to help protect it. blu and jewel eventually raise three chicks together and celebrate with rafael, nico, pedro, linda, luiz, and tlio. meanwhile, nigel is revealed to have survived the plane crash but mauro ridicules him for his loss of feathers and marcel and the smugglers are arrested.

== production ==
saldanha first had the idea for the film in 1995, involving a penguin being washed up on the beaches of ipanema; it was changed to the current story after he learned of happy feet and surf's up (two other films involving penguins) being produced. he pitched the idea to chris wedge at blue sky in 2006. saldanha showed the animators maps and books with geographic landmarks and measurements, from which they built a digital version of rio. later, a group of artists from the company visited rio to see the various story locations. the animators also met with an expert on macaws at the bronx zoo to gain insight into their movement and personalities. saldanha himself is a brazilian from rio de janeiro; such elements of brazilian culture and landmarks were also influenced from saldanha growing up in brazil.the lead voice actors were approached in 2009. jemaine clement was approached to do the film after seeing test shots of his character nigel doing a speech from flight of the conchords, which was done prior to a script being finalized. neil patrick harris was supposed to voice blu, but had other commitments outside production; he was later replaced by jesse eisenberg. eisenberg was asked during the filming of the social network if he would do his voice recording on the weekends, and he agreed after reading the script, saying: "it was the perfect antidote to get out of the mindset of my character in social network who was so severe, and in some ways so joyless."for music, they brought on board srgio mendes to act as music guru and online living library. he in turn was able to reach out to artists such as will.i.am and carlinhos brown to provide music for the film.eisenberg and anne hathaway, who voiced jewel, had acted together before when both were still teenagers, when they played siblings in the short-lived 1999 tv show get real. hathaway stated in an interview that she didn't see eisenberg during production of rio except "socially throughout the process," but that she was "very happy for all of his success."
