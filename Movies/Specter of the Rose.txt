== reception ==
when the film was released, variety magazine gave the film a mixed review.  the staff wrote, "ben hecht, to say the least, has done the expected by coming up with the unusual. specter of the rose was obviously a conscious attempt by hecht to prove on how small a budget he could produce an acceptable picture. reports are that it cost in the neighborhood of $160,000. the serious defect production wise is a general lack of polish that is at times disturbing ... hechts direction and dialog give the acting a stylized artificiality that grows on the spectator as the picture progresses. satire of the characterizations makes many of the films people virtually caricatures."
