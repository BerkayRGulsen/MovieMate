kal aaj aur kal (transl.yesterday, today and tomorrow) is a 1971 indian hindi film produced by raj kapoor and directed by his son randhir kapoor. the film's usp is the appearance of three generations of the famous kapoor family starring prithviraj kapoor, his son raj kapoor, raj kapoor's son randhir kapoor (in his acting debut) and randhir's real-life wife-to-be babita. among the non kapoors in the film are iftekhar.it was also the last shankar jaikishan score in a raj kapoor film; it contains superhit songs like "aap yahan aaye kis liye" and "bhanware ki gunjan". this film came after the heavy debacle of mera naam joker, which was raj kapoor's dream project. it more than made up for his loss although it was still only a moderate success at the box office. the film marked one of prithviraj kapoor's final films as he died the following year of the film's release in 1972.
