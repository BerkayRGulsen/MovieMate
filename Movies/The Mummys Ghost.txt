== stephen sommers series (19992008) ==
originally a proposed remake of the mummy would have been directed by horror filmmaker/writer clive barker. barker's vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies. barker's take was "dark, sexual and filled with mysticism", and that, "it would have been a great low-budget movie".in 1999, stephen sommers wrote and directed a remake of the mummy, loosely based on the original film of 1932. this film switches genres from the emphasis on horror to adventure, concentrating more on action sequences, special effects, comedy, and a higher element of egyptian lore. the film became a box office success spawning two sequels, several video games, a spin-off series, and an animated television series. the first two films received mixed to positive reviews, while the third one received mostly negative reviews.
