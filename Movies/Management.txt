== plot ==
in 1978 brooklyn, as a young dave buznik is about to experience his first kiss, he is humiliated by local bully arnie shankman who suddenly pulls down his pants and underwear.
twenty-five years later, dave works as a secretary for a disrespectful boss named frank. dave's bullying trauma causes him to avoid displaying affection such as kissing his girlfriend linda in public. his problems are exacerbated by his narcissistic co-worker, andrew, who is close friends with linda and desires to rekindle their romantic relationship.
during a flight dave loses his temper, albeit mildly, after being treated disrespectfully by the flight attendant, prompting the sky marshal to taser him. he is arrested for "assaulting" a flight attendant and is sentenced to anger management under dr buddy rydell, a renowned therapist who sat next to him on the plane. dave's sentence is extended to 30 days after he accidentally breaks a waitresss nose while defending himself. 
buddy elects to live with dave and accompany him at work as part of his "radical round-the-clock therapy". this entails unorthodox techniques which cause dave to be passive aggressive. at dave's workplace buddy is shocked to learn of the well endowed andrew's friendship with linda. however, buddy sees a photo of linda and becomes instantly smitten by her, annoying dave. to enhance dave's assertiveness buddy arranges for him to get revenge on arnie shankman, who has become a buddhist monk. arnie apologises to dave, but he laughs when reminded of the kiss incident. buddy and an initially hesitant dave provoke arnie by lying about dave molesting arnie's mentally ill sister. a fight ensues, and after defeating arnie the duo flee and dave is delighted to have had his revenge. 
linda tells dave she has agreed to follow buddy's advice that they have a trial separation; buddy explains to dave that this is to give him time to improve his behaviour. dave attacks buddy when he learns he and linda have begun dating. dave returns to court where buddy is issued with a restraining order against him. dave snaps at work when he learns frank promoted andrew to the position he had expected. he punches andrew in the face and wrecks frank's office with a golf club. 
learning from andrew that buddy has taken linda to a new york yankees game, dave assumes buddy intends to steal his marriage proposal idea and races to the stadium. security captures him but new york mayor rudy giuliani orders them to allow dave to speak. linda is moved when dave announces publicly that he is willing to change. at her request dave kisses linda in front of the crowd and she accepts his proposal. linda then reveals that the game was the final phase of his therapy and explains that the aggravation he endured was all buddy's doing. she adds that most of the people involved were in on buddy's plans.
