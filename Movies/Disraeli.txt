== plot ==
in 1874, disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at extending the british empire, is voted down by the house of commons after a speech by his great rival, william gladstone. later, disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift khedive of egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the suez canal. the purchase of the canal would secure control of india, but michael probert, head of the bank of england, makes it clear to disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. disraeli then summons hugh myers, a leading jewish banker.
meanwhile, lord charles deeford proposes to lady clarissa pevensey. although she is in love with him, she turns him down. he is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the prime minister and charles has no strong opinion about him. disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting clarissa to be happy, convinces charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase.
but he does not tell him about the spies. russia, eager to seize india for itself, has assigned two spies to watch disraeli: mrs. travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and mr. foljambe. disraeli was not fooled; he has hired foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. when foljambe asks charles if myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that foljambe has guessed correctly. mrs. travers orders foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters.
disraeli soon discovers what has happened. when he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, clarissa suggests he send charles. charles persuades the khedive to accept myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to clarissa.
disraeli is elated when he receives the news. however, myers comes and informs him that his banking house has been driven into bankruptcy by sabotage; the cheque is worthless. disraeli tells him to keep his situation secret for the moment. when the prying mrs. travers arrives, disraeli allows her to learn of the purchase, and she exultantly admits to her key part in sabotaging myers.
thinking quickly, disraeli summons probert. though the banker initially refuses to help, disraeli forces him to sign a paper giving unlimited credit to myers by threatening to have parliament revoke the bank's charter. (after probert leaves, disraeli confesses to his wife and clarissa that he was bluffing.) myers' solvency is restored, the deal is completed, and as a result of disraeli's success, queen victoria can add empress of india to her other titles.
