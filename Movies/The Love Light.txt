== reception ==
photoplay published a very critical review by burns mantle. he wrote, in summary, "the love light is a poor picture in the sense of being quite unworthy of the star's talents. the story is developed without reasonable logic and filmed with only the value of the pictures in mind. the love light's one value to my mind is that it takes the nation's sweetheart out of curls and short frocks and makes a woman of her."
