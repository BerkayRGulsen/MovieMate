=== critical response ===
review aggregator rotten tomatoes gives the film a "rotten" rating of 27% based on 108 reviews. the site's consensus states, "its leads are likeable, but remember me suffers from an overly maudlin script and a borderline offensive final twist." metacritic gives it a score of 40 out of 100, based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".todd mccarthy gave the film a mixed review in variety, writing "the modestly scaled film delivers some moving and affecting moments amid a preponderance of scenes of frequently annoying people behaving badly."  andrea gronvall gave a similar assessment in the chicago reader, writing "allen coulter directed this morose and sluggish drama, which gets more mileage from pattinson's anguished profile than from will fetters's thunderously overwritten screenplay."  derek malcolm wrote in this is london, "decently shot and directed as it is, it lacks any real flame."  kirk honeycutt of the hollywood reporter gave the film a positive review, stating the "scenes between pattinson and de ravin exude genuine charm." honeycutt goes on to say that the score and cinematography brought "notable sparkle to this heartfelt drama."jake coyle of the associated press did not favor the film and said the "most pleasing thing about [the film] is its boldness. it may be affected, but [it] is at least aiming for an intriguing character study  a positive sign in the young career of pattinson," who he says steps away from "twilight, apparently in search of his five easy pieces or rebel without a cause." lisa schwarzbaum of entertainment weekly gave the film a d+, calling it a "shameless contraption of ridiculously sad things befalling attractive people." schwarzbaum was also critical of pattinson's acting and the script. wesley morris of the boston globe gave the film a half star out of four, commenting that the film "crassly repurposes tragedy to excuse its cliches." other critics also found the movie's invocation of the september 11 attacks on the world trade center offensive and exploitative, such as lisa kennedy of the denver post, who wrote "the finale manages to be tasteful and exploitative at the same time. it touts forgiveness while being mildly infuriating. such is the danger of borrowing from the enormous to merely entertain. if that. forgettable should be the last thing a movie touching on the events of 9/11 should be. yet 'remember me' is just that."  elizabeth weitzman of the new york daily news also denounced the film's ending, writing, "there's no shame in exploring tragedy through art. but exploiting it to make your very ordinary movie feel more important? that's another story."roger ebert generally liked the film, giving it three out of four stars and characterizing it as a "well-made movie. i cared about the characters. i felt for them. liberate them from the plot's destiny, which is an anvil around their necks, and you might have something" but goes on to say it "tries to borrow profound meaning, but succeeds only in upstaging itself so overwhelmingly that its characters become irrelevant".
