three prisoners escape from a chain gang, and two of them, wayne and harry (zahn and northam) run away to happy, texas, where they pose as the gay organizers of a beauty pageant. they put on a show with the small girls of the town while hiding from the law and waiting for the opportunity to rob the local bank.
their scheme is complicated by the fact that the local sheriff (macy) is gay, and he is attracted to the prisoner harry. straight harry, on the other hand, is attracted to local lady banker josephine (walker). meanwhile, "gay" david, also actually straight, gets it on with the local pageant coordinator, doreen (douglas).
by the pageant day, the third convict has appeared, and makes wayne and harry organize a break in during the show. harry calls in more police, and in the process, all three are aprehended. in the last scene, the pageant group that wayne helped train came to the prison to show them the closing number, in the costumes he made.
