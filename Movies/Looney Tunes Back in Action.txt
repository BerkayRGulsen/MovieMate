== plot ==
tired of playing second banana to bugs bunny, daffy duck demands his own cartoon from warner bros., but is promptly fired by the "vice-president of comedy", kate houghton. security guard and aspiring stuntman, dj drake is asked to escort daffy off the studio lot, but the ensuing chase leads to the batmobile demolishing the studio water tower, causing dj to also get fired in the process. he returns home with daffy hitching a ride, where he receives a message from his father, action film star, damian drake, who is actually a secret agent. damian instructs his son to travel to las vegas, find his associate, dusty tails, and find a mystical diamond called the "blue monkey" diamond, before he is shortly thereafter captured by the acme corporation, led by the childish mr. chairman. dj and daffy head for vegas. meanwhile, bugs' routines fall apart without daffy, so kate is forced to find and rehire daffy or face being terminated herself. bugs informs kate of the situation, so they head to dj's home where they find damian's spy car, and use it to pursue dj and daffy.
in las vegas, dj and daffy meet dusty in a casino owned by yosemite sam, who happens to be an operative of the acme corporation. dusty gives them a strange playing card, which is a clue to finding the diamond. sam and his henchmen attempt to kill them and take the card, but they manage to elude him and flee in the spy car with bugs and kate. the spy car, which can also fly, crashes in the nevada desert. as they traverse the desert, wile e. coyote tries to stop them, but fails. the group eventually stumbles upon area 52, run by a woman called 'mother', who informs them of the situation. she plays a video recording, which reveals that the blue monkey has the power to devolve humans into monkeys and evolve them back again. acme intends on using the blue monkey on all of mankind to manufacture their products, and then turn them back to purchase them. marvin the martian, who was imprisoned in the facility, escapes and leads a group of fellow alien inmates to obtain the playing card, but the heroes escape. seeing that the card has mona lisa's face on it, the group conclude they must view the painting in the louvre, located in paris.
at the louvre, they discover that the card contains a viewing window, and looking through it, the window reveals that the mona lisa has a map of africa hidden beneath. bugs and daffy's co-star, elmer fudd, appears, revealing himself as an acme operative, and chases bugs and daffy through the gallery for the card whilst kate is kidnapped by mr. chairman's bodyguard, mr. smith, to obtain a photo of the african map with help of beaky buzzard. dj rescues kate and elmer is disintegrated by bugs after jumping out of a pointillism artwork. bugs and daffy reunite with dj and kate, and they leave paris.
dj, kate, bugs, and daffy travel to africa, meeting granny, sylvester, and tweety, who escort them to the ruins of a jungle temple where they find the blue monkey. however, granny and company reveal themselves to be mr. chairman, smith, and the tasmanian devil in disguise. mr. chairman uses a disintegration gun to transport himself and the heroes to the acme headquarters where he forces dj to give him the diamond, when damian is revealed to be his prisoner, but goes back on his word to release him.
marvin is sent to place the blue monkey on an acme satellite which will emit an energy beam around the world to turn everyone, except mr. chairman, into monkeys. dj and kate rescue damian from a death trap, whilst bugs and daffy pursue marvin into space. bugs is incapacitated, prompting daffy to become duck dodgers, in order to destroy the blue monkey. the transforming energy beam only strikes mr. chairman, turning him into a monkey. bugs and daffy return to earth, where daffy discovers the whole adventure was staged to make a film. however, bugs promises daffy they will be equal partners, but just as daffy's luck seems to be improving, he is flattened by the looney tunes iris, where porky pig attempts to close the film with "that's all folks!" only for the studio to shut down before he can finish, and he tells the audience to go home.

== production ==
looney tunes: back in action was initially developed as a follow-up to space jam (1996). as development began, the film's plot was going to involve a new basketball competition between the looney tunes and a new villain named berserk-o!. artist bob camp was tasked with designing berserk-o! and his henchmen. joe pytka would have returned to direct and spike brandt and tony cervone signed on as the animation supervisors. however, michael jordan did not agree to star in a sequel. according to camp, a producer lied to design artists, claiming that jordan had signed on in order to keep development going. warner bros. pictures eventually cancelled plans for space jam 2.the film then re-entered development as spy jam and was to star jackie chan. warner bros. was also planning a film titled race jam, which would have starred racing driver jeff gordon. both projects were ultimately cancelled. warner bros. eventually asked joe dante to direct back in action. in the early 1990s, dante wanted to produce a biographical comedy with hbo, called termite terrace. it centered around director filmmaker and cartoonist chuck jones' early years at warner bros. in the 1930s. on the project, dante recalled, "it was a hilarious story and it was very good except that warner bros. said, 'look, it's an old story. it's got period stuff in it. we don't want that. we want to rebrand our characters and we want to do space jam.'"dante agreed to direct back in action as tribute to jones. he and screenwriter larry doyle reportedly wanted the film to be the "anti-space jam" as dante disliked how that film represented the looney tunes brand and personalities. dante said, "i was making a movie for them with those characters [looney tunes: back in action] and they did not want to know about those characters. they didn't want to know why bugs bunny shouldn't do hip-hop. it was a pretty grim experience all around." warner bros. hired walt disney feature animation's eric goldberg, most known for his fast-paced, warner bros.-inspired animation of the genie in aladdin (1992), to direct the animation.
on the film, dante stated, "it's a gagfest. not having a particularly strong story, it just goes from gag to gag and location to location. it's not a particularly compelling narrative, but, of course, that's not where the charm of the movie is supposed to lie." on the subject of filming, dante said, "[w]e would shoot each scene three times. first we'd rehearse with a stand-ina 'stuffy,' we called it. then, we'd shoot the scene without anything in it; then, we'd shoot the scene again with this mirror ball in the shot which shows the computers where the light sources are. then the animators would go to work and put characters into the frame." according to dante, a "problem" occurred when the studio executives got tired of the film's jokes and wanted them to be changed. as a result, the studio brought in twenty-five gag writers to try to write jokes that were short enough to fit into an animated character's mouth. despite this, the film has only one credited writer.despite being directed by acknowledged fans of the original cartoons, dante stated that he had no creative freedom on the project, and called it "the longest year and a half of my life." dante felt that he and goldberg managed to preserve the original personalities of the characters. however, the opening, middle, and end of the film are different from what dante envisioned.


== soundtrack ==
this was the final film scored by composer jerry goldsmith. due to goldsmith's failing health, the last reel of the film was actually scored by john debney, though goldsmith was the only credited composer in marketing materials and the varse sarabande soundtrack album only contains goldsmith's music (although the first and last cues are adaptations of compositions heard in warner bros. cartoons). debney receives an "additional music by" credit in the closing titles of the film and "special thanks" in the soundtrack album credits. goldsmith died in july 2004, eight months after the film's release.
