== plot ==
sergeant peter king and private leslie cuthbertson of the royal army dental corps passionately desire to see active service, but are held back. armed with two revolvers and a handful of grenades, they plan an unauthorised mission to occupied france. they write to the prime minister, winston churchill, explaining their intention to fight the germans. after they finally succeed in getting to france, they stumble across a german radar station. they blow up what they take to be the main operations room, and then the entire compound unexpectedly erupts with gunfire and explosions. they narrowly evade the germans and escape in a boat which is later blown up by a mine; the men are picked up by the british and interrogated as possible spies. once their identities have been established, they are returned to barracks to be court-martialed as deserters.
an aide of churchill had seen their letter, and knew of a commando raid on the radar facility which was facilitated by a diversion due to mysterious explosions in what they discover was actually the cookhouse. the aide intervenes in the court martial, establishes their presence at the enemy radar station and conveys an invitation to tea with the prime minister should they ever be in whitehall. the court nevertheless demotes sergeant king to the rank of corporal and remands private cuthbertson to military prison for 28 days, lenient sentences for desertion in wartime. a note on screen tells the viewer that the men never meet again.
