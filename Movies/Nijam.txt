== reception and collections ==
idlebrain jeevi in his review gave a rating of 3 out of 5 for the movie with concluding remarks "overall, it's an average film that has chances to become hit because of the teja's mass-attracting episodes and mahesh babu's brilliant portrayal of the character".director teja in an interview said "we made nijam in a budget of 6.5 cr inr; we sold audio rights for 2 cr inr and movie initially were sold for a total of 26 cr inr. in total, we made a profit of 5-6 cr inr and nijam was not a flop". he corroborated the same in an interview with the hindu "i worked with mahesh after he had a flop called bobby, but nijam released after okkadu and people drew comparisons. i dont argue when people say nijam was a flop. the film was made with a budget of rs. 6.5 crore and sold for rs. 21 crore. i repaid money to whoever lost money and still made a huge profit".
