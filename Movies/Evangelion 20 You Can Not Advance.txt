evangelion: 2.0 you can (not) advance. (: , evangerion shin gekijban: ha, lit. "evangelion: the new movie: break") is a 2009 japanese animated science fiction action film directed by kazuya tsurumaki and masayuki, and written by hideaki anno. it is the second of tetralogy of films released in the rebuild of evangelion. the tetralogy is based on the original anime series neon genesis evangelion. it was produced and co-distributed by hideaki anno's studio khara in partnership with gainax.
the film continues the story of evangelion: 1.0 you are (not) alone, with shinji ikari continuing his role as a pilot of one of the gigantic evangelion as part of nerv's ongoing fight against the mysterious creatures known as angels. while replicating many scenes and plot elements from the original series, the film also introduces new ones, including newly designed creatures and new characters, such as mari illustrious makinami, and integrates newly available 3d cg technology. its ending paves the way for the significant storyline departures from the original series in evangelion: 3.0 you can (not) redo.


== plot ==
the third angel escapes its confinement and tries to break out of nerv's arctic bethany base, but mari illustrious makinami, a new pilot, launches evangelion provisional unit-05 and destroys the angel by self-destructing the eva and safely ejecting at the last moment.
meanwhile, shinji ikari and his father gendo visit mother and wife yui's grave. shortly after, the seventh angel attacks, but is quickly dispatched by the newly arrived unit-02 and its headstrong pilot, asuka langley shikinami. ryoji kaji delivers to gendo a suitcase containing the mysterious "key of nebuchadnezzar" and notes that the destruction of unit-05 went as planned. gendo and kozo fuyutsuki then visit nerv's lunar compound, tabgha base, to view the construction of evangelion mark.06, which is noted as being different from the other evas. they are denied permission to land, but briefly see kaworu nagisa sitting in space without a space suit. during gendo's absence, the eighth angel attacks tokyo-3. shinji, asuka, and rei kill it in an improvised plan devised by misato katsuragi. both unit-00 and unit-01 are damaged. gendo returns and asks to have them both repaired, but seele only allows the repair of unit-01.
in an attempt to heal the relationship between gendo and shinji, rei prepares a dinner party. at the same time, mari arrives in tokyo-3. later, unit-04 and nerv's u.s. branch are destroyed during an experiment, prompting the u.s. government to send unit-03 to tokyo-3. due to an international agreement that allows no more than three functioning evangelions per country at a time, nerv seals away unit-02 and schedules a test of unit-03 on the same day as rei's dinner party; asuka volunteers to take rei's place as the test pilot, to avoid the party. once asuka activates unit-03, the ninth angel possesses the eva and goes on a rampage. shinji pilots unit-01, but refuses to fight the angel for fear of harming asuka, who is still trapped inside. gendo orders the activation of the dummy system, which makes unit-01 autonomous, and allows it to savagely destroy unit-03, crushing the cockpit in its teeth. emotionally wounded by his father's cold decision, shinji leaves nerv.
asuka survives, but is grievously injured and placed in quarantine for fear of mental contamination by the angel. shinji heads out of the city, but the tenth angel attacks, so he flees to an emergency shelter. gendo fails to activate unit-01 without shinji, so mari hijacks unit-02 and heads out to fight the angel alone. she removes unit-02's limiters and launches an all-out attack, but the angel severely damages unit-02. rei joins the fight with the damaged unit-00 and charges at the angel with a missile. the missile detonates, but fails to destroy the angel. the angel consumes unit-00 and integrates it with its own body, allowing it to bypass nerv's defenses.
upon seeing rei consumed along with unit-00, shinji rushes to gendo and asks to pilot unit-01 again. shinji fends off the angel, but before he can defeat it, unit-01 runs out of power and shuts down. unit-01 reactivates in berserk mode in response to shinji's rage at the loss of rei. it easily takes down the angel, and shinji uses the eva to reach inside the angel's core to save rei. unit-01 then starts transcending its physical boundaries to grant shinji's wish. at the moment shinji retrieves rei, unit-01 pulls unit-00's core out of the angel. the angel explodes and its remains, along with unit-00's core, are absorbed into unit-01, fusing them all into one being. unit-01 then sprouts giant wings of light, and misato, who has been watching the battle, sees that they are identical to the ones she saw during second impact. ritsuko realizes that the eva has become a divine being, triggering third impact and declares this to be the end of the world.
in a post-credits scene, a spear shoots down from the moon and impales unit-01 in the middle of its apotheosis, neutralizing it and stopping third impact. kaworu then descends from the moon in mark.06, saying that this time, he will show shinji true happiness.

=== critical response ===
justin sevakis of anime news network praised the new character interactions and development, stating "evangelion 2.0 feels as though the project has been put on mood stabilizers: it's not any happier, but it's more stable and certainly more focused. and in the end, it's a vast improvement." reviewing the us blu-ray release for ann, theron martin wrote that 2.0's asuka is "distinct from the get-go, too, as she is less bratty and more aggressively antisocial than the first one. she may have initially seemed to be the most socially adjusted eva pilot in the tv series, but here she makes no pretenses about liking anyone  not even kaji, whom she hopelessly mooned over in the tv series but doesn't give a second thought here  and seems motivated as much by establishing herself in a future career path in nerv as she is by her personal pride" and praised anno's technique where "the peak moments of the most gruesome [scene] are set to a gentle, vocalized children's song which, paradoxically, makes the scenes all the more horrific."
mania.com reviewer chris beveridge wrote that "watching the second installment of evangelion is more rewarding and more difficult than the first. it's more rewarding because you're seeing this interpretation taking on its own life fully, from the way asuka is introduced, the new character of mari and the larger scope of how the world works with evangelion units...they go big here with a lot of changes, changes that could annoy and irk the faithful, but it's an interpretation that is doing something different at this point and it does it well, giving it all the kind of smoothness it needs, even if it does feel rushed sometimes when there are so many angel fights throughout it." many reviews praised the action scenes (the boston globe criticizing their aesthetic as "exhausting"); the toronto star writes: "sparing no time to get newbies up to speed, evangelion 2.0 will undoubtedly confound some viewers with its jam-packed narrative and jargon-heavy dialogue but the intricately designed, hyper-kinetic visuals more than compensate, especially when seen at the scale they deserve." the  chicago sun-times likewise praised the action, but criticized the soundtrack for being "a weird array of elevator-style music."the kansas city star's reviewer wrote "the peripheral characters are hard to keep track of, and a medieval theologian would be weirded out by all the mystical gibberish", but also praised the "terrific battle scenes and gorgeous animation. those elements dont compensate for every shortcoming, but they make a challenging genre much easier for novices to enjoy." naw: "having introduced mari so vividly, though, the film forgets about her for about 40 minutes....she doesnt reappear until halfway through the film. and her purpose remains elusive." fort worth weekly's reviewer, on the other hand, praised the mystical gibberish and otaku references: "this movie trafficks in judeo-christian symbolism and references that often lean toward the obscure. this, along with its meta-commentary on anime itself and the ways its fans relate to it, helps set the movie apart from its fellows." the film currently holds a 75% "fresh" rating on rotten tomatoes.


=== accolades ===
the film won first place in the animation category of the french lyon asian film festival, narrowly beating symphony in august in an audience vote. it won the award for excellent animation of the year by being nominated for the japan academy prize for animation of the year in 2010. stills and draft materials from 2.0 by hideaki anno were exhibited at de:knstlerhaus bethanien in germany as part of the proto anime cut exhibition in januarymarch 2011, with a european tour planned in summer 2012.


== sequel ==
